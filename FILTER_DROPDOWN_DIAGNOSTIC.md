# 🔍 FILTER DROPDOWN DIAGNOSTIC

## What to Test in Browser Console

After opening https://weddingbazaarph.web.app and navigating to Individual → Bookings:

### 1. Check Initial State
Look for these logs in console:
```
🔍 [useBookingPreferences Debug] Raw filter status: all
🔍 [useBookingPreferences Debug] Final filter status: all
🔍 [Filter Debug] ===== FILTER EXECUTION =====
🔍 [Filter Debug] Current filter status: all
🔍 [Filter Debug] Total bookings: 34
```

### 2. Test Dropdown Interaction
Click the filter dropdown and select "Request Sent", you should see:
```
🎯 [DROPDOWN DEBUG] Filter dropdown changed!
🎯 [DROPDOWN DEBUG] Old value: all
🎯 [DROPDOWN DEBUG] New value: quote_requested
🎯 [DROPDOWN DEBUG] Calling setFilterStatus...
🎯 [DROPDOWN DEBUG] setFilterStatus called!
🎯 [FilterStatus Debug] Setting filter status: quote_requested
🎯 [FILTER STATE DEBUG] filterStatus changed to: quote_requested
🔍 [Filter Debug] ===== FILTER EXECUTION =====
🔍 [Filter Debug] Current filter status: quote_requested
🔍 [Filter Debug] Filtered count: 32 (or similar)
```

### 3. Visual Changes Expected
- Filter dropdown should show "Request Sent" selected
- Only bookings with status "quote_requested" should be visible
- Debug indicator should show: `DEBUG: Current filter = "quote_requested"`

### 4. Test Other Filters
Select "Approved/Confirmed" (mapped to `confirmed`):
- Should show only 1 booking (booking #25 with `status: 'approved'` → `'confirmed'`)
- Console should log filtered count: 1

## If No Debug Logs Appear:
- The dropdown onChange is not firing
- There might be a JavaScript error preventing the handler from executing
- Check for any console errors that might be blocking the functionality

## Current Status From Your Logs:
✅ Bookings loading: 34 bookings loaded successfully
✅ Status mapping: `request` → `quote_requested` working
✅ Filter logic: useEffect and filtering function present
❌ Missing: Dropdown interaction logs - **this is the issue**

/**
 * BOOKING DATA ANALYSIS RESULT
 * ==============================================
 * 
 * ‚ùå YES, THE BOOKINGS ARE MOCK DATA
 * 
 * EVIDENCE:
 * 1. IndividualBookings.tsx calls bookingApiService.getCoupleBookings()
 * 2. This method DOES NOT EXIST in bookingApiService.ts
 * 3. The bookingApiService only has getUserBookings() method
 * 4. getUserBookings() returns MOCK_BOOKINGS array (hardcoded data)
 * 5. The MOCK_BOOKINGS contains fake booking data like:
 *    - booking-1, booking-2, booking-3 (fake IDs)
 *    - User '1-2025-001' with hardcoded bookings
 *    - Fake venues like "Fernbrook Gardens" and "Tagaytay Garden Venues"
 *    - Hardcoded prices like ‚Ç±105,000, ‚Ç±150,000, etc.
 * 
 * REAL API ENDPOINTS EXIST BUT ARE NOT USED:
 * - Backend has /api/bookings/couple/:coupleId endpoint
 * - Real database integration exists in server/index.ts
 * - But frontend doesn't call these real endpoints
 * 
 * WHAT'S HAPPENING:
 * 1. User sees 4 bookings in IndividualBookings page
 * 2. These are from MOCK_BOOKINGS array in bookingApiService.ts
 * 3. The data is completely fake/hardcoded
 * 4. No real database calls are being made
 * 5. The method getCoupleBookings() doesn't exist, so likely throws error
 *    or falls back to mock data
 * 
 * SOLUTION NEEDED:
 * Either:
 * A) Add getCoupleBookings() method to make real API calls
 * B) Change IndividualBookings to call getUserBookings() or real API
 * C) Fix the integration to use /api/bookings/couple/:coupleId endpoint

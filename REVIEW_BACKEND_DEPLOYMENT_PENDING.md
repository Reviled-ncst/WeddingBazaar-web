# ⚠️ Review System Backend Deployment Required

## Current Status

**Date**: October 28, 2025 - 8:16 AM PHT  
**Frontend**: ✅ Deployed to Firebase  
**Backend**: ⏳ Waiting for Render deployment  

---

## Issue

The review system backend endpoints were added to the codebase and pushed to GitHub, but Render has not yet deployed the new version. The production backend is still running version `2.7.1-PUBLIC-SERVICE-DEBUG` from ~6 minutes ago.

### Symptoms
- Frontend shows: `❌ [ReviewService] Error submitting review: Error: Authentication failed`
- Backend `/api/health` endpoint doesn't list `/api/reviews` in active endpoints
- Review submission fails with 401 or 404 errors

---

## Required Endpoints (Not Yet Deployed)

1. **POST `/api/reviews`** - Submit a new review (requires authentication)
2. **GET `/api/reviews/booking/:bookingId`** - Check if booking has been reviewed (requires authentication)
3. **GET `/api/reviews/vendor/:vendorId`** - Get all reviews for a vendor (public)
4. **GET `/api/reviews/service/:serviceId`** - Get all reviews for a service (public)

---

## Solution

### Option 1: Wait for Auto-Deployment (Recommended)
Render should auto-deploy within 5-10 minutes of the GitHub push. Monitor deployment at:
- https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-ctdqvdaj1k6c73avdvmg/deploys

### Option 2: Manual Deployment Trigger
1. Login to Render dashboard
2. Go to `weddingbazaar-web` service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for build and deployment

### Option 3: Verify Deployment Hook
Check if Render's GitHub webhook is properly configured:
1. Go to GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to Webhooks
3. Verify Render webhook is active and receiving push events

---

## Verification Steps

### Step 1: Check Backend Version
```bash
curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/health
```

Look for updated version number or `/api/reviews` in endpoints list.

### Step 2: Test Review Endpoint
```bash
curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/reviews/vendor/2-2025-001
```

Should return 200 OK with empty array or reviews (not 404).

### Step 3: Test Review Submission
1. Login to https://weddingbazaarph.web.app/individual/bookings
2. Click "Rate & Review" on completed booking
3. Submit 5-star review
4. Should see success message (not "Authentication failed")

---

## Temporary Workaround

While waiting for deployment, the frontend will gracefully handle the missing endpoint:
- "Rate & Review" button still shows (can't check if reviewed yet)
- Clicking button opens modal
- Submission fails with user-friendly error message
- No crashes or broken UI

---

## After Deployment

Once Render deploys the new backend:

1. **Refresh the frontend** (hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Test review submission**:
   - Navigate to completed booking
   - Click "Rate & Review"
   - Submit review with 5 stars
   - Verify success message
   - Refresh page → button should disappear

3. **Verify database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM reviews ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```

4. **Check vendor rating updated**:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, business_name, rating, total_reviews 
   FROM vendors 
   WHERE id = '2-2025-001';
   ```

---

## Database Migration Required

Before testing reviews, ensure the `reviews` table exists:

```bash
node create-reviews-table.cjs
```

This creates:
- `reviews` table with proper schema
- Indexes for performance
- UNIQUE constraint to prevent duplicate reviews

---

## Expected Timeline

- **Code Push**: ✅ Completed at 8:10 AM
- **Render Build**: ⏳ Expected ~5 minutes
- **Render Deploy**: ⏳ Expected ~2 minutes  
- **Total**: Should be live by 8:20 AM PHT

---

## Monitoring Commands

### Check if Render is deploying
```bash
# Health check (every 30 seconds)
while ($true) { 
  $v = (Invoke-WebRequest "https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/health" | ConvertFrom-Json).version; 
  Write-Host "$(Get-Date -Format 'HH:mm:ss') - Version: $v"; 
  Start-Sleep 30 
}
```

### Check if reviews endpoint exists
```bash
# Test endpoint (returns 200 or 404)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/reviews/vendor/2-2025-001" -Method GET
```

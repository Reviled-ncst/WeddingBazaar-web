# 🚨 CRITICAL: Clear Browser Cache Before Testing

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Browser is Caching Old JavaScript

The logs show the **old code is still running** even after deployment. This is because:
1. Browser has cached the old JavaScript bundle (`index-CiLfIxmA.js`)
2. New deployment created new bundle (`index-BPC_dcYD.js`)
3. Browser is serving the cached old version

## ✅ SOLUTION: Force Hard Refresh

### Method 1: Hard Refresh (Recommended)
**Windows/Linux:**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Or `Ctrl + F5`

**Mac:**
- Press `Cmd + Shift + R`

### Method 2: Clear Cache via DevTools
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the **Refresh button**
3. Select "**Empty Cache and Hard Reload**"

### Method 3: Clear All Browser Data
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Click "Clear data"
4. Refresh the page

### Method 4: Incognito/Private Window
1. Open new Incognito/Private window
2. Navigate to https://weddingbazaarph.web.app
3. Login and test

## 🧪 How to Verify Cache is Cleared

After clearing cache, check the console for:

### OLD VERSION (Cached - BAD):
```javascript
🔍 Step 4: Getting Firebase ID token...  ← This should NOT appear!
```

### NEW VERSION (Fixed - GOOD):
```javascript
📥 Step 3: Getting backend JWT token from localStorage...  ← This SHOULD appear!
✅ Step 4: Backend JWT token validated (length: XXX)
```

## 📊 Test Flow After Cache Clear

1. **Clear browser cache** (use one of the methods above)
2. **Refresh page** (Ctrl + Shift + R)
3. **Login as vendor**
4. **Navigate to** `/vendor/services`
5. **Click** "Upgrade" button
6. **Select** Premium plan
7. **Pay** with test card: `4343434343434345`
8. **Watch console** for these logs:

```javascript
✅ Step 1: Payment successful
✅ Step 2: Payment modal closed
📥 Step 3: Getting backend JWT token from localStorage...  ← KEY!
✅ Step 4: Backend JWT token validated (length: XXX)
📦 Step 5: Building upgrade payload...
📤 Step 6: Making API call to upgrade endpoint
✅ Step 6: Fetch completed without throwing
📥 Step 7: Response status: 200  ← Should be 200, not 401!
✅ Step 8: Successfully upgraded vendor to the Premium plan!  ← SUCCESS!
```

## 🚨 If You Still See Old Logs

If after clearing cache you still see:
```javascript
🔍 Step 4: Getting Firebase ID token...
```

Try:
1. **Close all browser tabs**
2. **Restart browser completely**
3. **Open new Incognito window**
4. **Test again**

## 🔍 Deployment Verification

**Latest deployment:**
- **Time:** Just now (2024-10-27)
- **Bundle:** `index-BPC_dcYD.js` (NEW)
- **Status:** Live on Firebase
- **URL:** https://weddingbazaarph.web.app

**What changed:**
- Removed Firebase token acquisition
- Added localStorage JWT token retrieval
- Should show "Step 3: Getting backend JWT token"

## ✅ Success Indicators

After cache clear, you should see:
- ✅ NO "Firebase ID token" logs
- ✅ "Getting backend JWT token from localStorage" appears
- ✅ Response status 200 (not 401)
- ✅ Step 8 success message
- ✅ Upgrade prompt closes
- ✅ Subscription updates

## 📝 Quick Checklist

- [ ] Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + R)
- [ ] Verify new code is loaded (check console logs)
- [ ] Login as vendor
- [ ] Navigate to vendor services
- [ ] Trigger upgrade prompt
- [ ] Complete payment
- [ ] Verify Step 3 shows "Getting backend JWT token"
- [ ] Verify Step 7 shows 200 OK
- [ ] Verify Step 8 appears
- [ ] Verify UI updates

## 🎯 Expected Result

**After cache clear and payment:**
```
Payment succeeds → JWT from localStorage → API 200 OK → Step 8 success → Subscription upgraded
```

**NOT this (old cached code):**
```
Payment succeeds → Firebase token → API 401 Unauthorized → Upgrade failed
```

**CRITICAL: You MUST clear the browser cache to test the new code!**

**Status:** ✅ Deployed | ⏳ Waiting for cache clear

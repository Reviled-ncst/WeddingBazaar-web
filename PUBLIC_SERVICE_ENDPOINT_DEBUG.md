# Public Service Endpoint Debugging

## Issue
The backend endpoint `GET /api/services/:id` is returning a 500 Internal Server Error when accessing service SRV-0001, even though the service exists in the database.

## Verified
✅ Service SRV-0001 exists in database
✅ Backend endpoint code is deployed
✅ Route is defined in services.cjs

## Investigation
1. Service exists: `SELECT * FROM services WHERE id = 'SRV-0001'` returns the service
2. Endpoint returns 500 error when called from production URL
3. Need to check Render logs to see the specific error

## Next Steps
1. Check Render logs for the specific error message
2. Likely database connection or query syntax issue in production
3. May need to update SQL query syntax for production environment

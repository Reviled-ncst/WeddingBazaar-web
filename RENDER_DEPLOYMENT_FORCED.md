## 🔍 How to Monitor

### Method 1: Render Dashboard
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find: "weddingbazaar-backend" service
3. Look for: Blue "Deploying" indicator
4. Wait for: Green "Deploy succeeded" ✅

### Method 2: Check Logs
1. Go to dashboard
2. Click "Logs" tab
3. Watch for:
   ```
   ==> Building...
   ==> Deploying...
   ==> Deploy succeeded
   ```

### Method 3: Test API Endpoint
Every 30 seconds, try:
```
https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/services/SRV-0001
```

When it returns service data (not 500), it's ready!

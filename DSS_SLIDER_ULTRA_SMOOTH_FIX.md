## 🎯 Issue Reported

> "what's the point of a slider you can't slide it stops every 10"

**User Frustration:**
- Slider felt "sticky" and "jumpy"
- Couldn't make smooth, continuous movements
- Stopped at discrete intervals (every 5-10 guests)
- Didn't feel like a real slider - more like clicking buttons

---

## ✅ Solution: ULTRA-SMOOTH Dragging

### Critical Fix: Step Size = 1

```tsx
// ORIGINAL (Very Jumpy):
step="10"   // Only 48 positions: 20, 30, 40, 50, 60...
            // ❌ Stops every 10 guests - very noticeable

// FIRST ATTEMPT (Still Jumpy):
step="5"    // Only 96 positions: 20, 25, 30, 35, 40...
            // ❌ Still stops every 5 guests - user still frustrated

// FINAL FIX (Completely Smooth):
step="1"    // 480 positions: 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26...
            // ✅ SMOOTH AS BUTTER! No noticeable stops!
```

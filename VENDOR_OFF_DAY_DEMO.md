# 📅 Vendor Off-Day System - Live Demo Guide

## 🎯 **What is the Vendor Off-Day System?**

The Vendor Off-Day System allows wedding vendors to mark specific dates as "unavailable" in their booking calendar. This prevents customers from booking services on those dates and helps vendors manage their personal time, holidays, and business closures.

## 🖥️ **How to Access & Use**

- Go to: https://weddingbazaar-web.web.app/vendor

### 2. **Visual Interface Overview**
The calendar shows different colored dots for each day:
- 🟢 **Green**: Available (click to set as off day)
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Partially booked

- 🔴 **Red**: Off day (click to remove)

### 3. **Setting Off Days - 3 Easy Methods**

1. Click on any **green (available)** date
2. System instantly marks it as an off day with default reason "Personal time off"
3. Green success notification appears
4. Date immediately turns red 🔴

#### **Method 2: Remove Off Days (Instant)**
1. Click on any **red (off day)** date
2. Confirmation dialog shows current reason
3. Click "OK" to remove the off day
4. Date immediately turns green 🟢

#### **Method 3: Advanced Off Day Settings (Plus Button)**

```

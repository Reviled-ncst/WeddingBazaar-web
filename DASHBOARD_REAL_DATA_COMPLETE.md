## 🎯 Real Data Examples

### Sample Booking Creates:
```
Booking Status: confirmed
Service: Photography
Amount: ₱15,000
Event Date: 2025-06-15

Dashboard Shows:
✅ Budget: +₱15,000 spent
✅ Bookings: 1 confirmed
✅ Activity: "Photography Confirmed" - Just now
✅ Event: "Photography Appointment - Jun 15, 2025"
```

### After Payment:
```
Booking Status: paid_in_full
Amount: ₱15,000

Dashboard Shows:
✅ Budget: ₱15,000 fully paid
✅ Activity: "Payment Completed" - Just now
```

---

## 🔢 Statistics Calculation Logic

### Total Bookings
```typescript
bookings.length
```

### Pending Bookings
```typescript
bookings.filter(b => 
  ['request', 'quote_requested', 'quote_sent'].includes(b.status)
).length
```

### Confirmed Bookings
```typescript
bookings.filter(b => 
  ['confirmed', 'deposit_paid', 'paid_in_full'].includes(b.status)
).length
```

### Total Spent
```typescript
bookings.reduce((sum, booking) => {
  const amount = booking.final_price || 
                 booking.quoted_price || 
                 booking.downpayment_amount || 
                 booking.total_paid || 0;
  return sum + amount;
}, 0)
```

---

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **Single API Call**: Fetches all bookings once
2. **Client-Side Calculations**: Stats calculated from cached data
3. **Memoization Ready**: Can add useMemo for expensive calculations
4. **Lazy Loading**: Activities limited to 10 most recent
5. **Efficient Filters**: Uses native array methods

---

## 🐛 Error Handling

### API Errors
```typescript
try {
  const data = await dashboardService.getIndividualDashboard(userId);
  setDashboardData(data);
} catch (err) {
  setError(err.message);
  // Shows error message with "Try Again" button
}
```

### Missing User ID
```typescript
if (!user?.id) {
  console.log('No user ID, using fallback');
  // Shows empty states
}
```

### Backend Offline
```typescript
// CentralizedBookingAPI has retry logic
// Falls back to simulated data if needed
```

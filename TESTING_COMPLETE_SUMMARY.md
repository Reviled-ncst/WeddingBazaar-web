## 🚀 How to Complete Manual Testing

### Step 1: Login as Vendor
```
URL: https://weddingbazaarph.web.app/login
Email: vendor4@test.com
Password: Test1234

Then navigate to: /vendor/finances
```

### Step 2: Login as Couple
```
URL: https://weddingbazaarph.web.app/login
Email: user2@test.com
Password: Test1234

Then navigate to: /individual/transactions
```

### Step 3: Use Browser DevTools
```javascript
// Open Console (F12) and run:
console.log('User role:', localStorage.getItem('user_role'));
console.log('JWT token:', localStorage.getItem('jwt_token') ? 'Present' : 'Missing');

// Test amount formatting
const test = 1892800;
console.log(`₱${(test / 100).toFixed(2).replace(/\d(?=(\d{3})+\.)/g, '$&,')}`);
// Should show: ₱18,928.00
```

### Step 4: Check Network Tab
```
1. Open DevTools → Network tab
2. Filter by "transactions" or "receipts"
3. Reload page
4. Check API request:
   - Status should be 200
   - Response should have "success": true
   - Authorization header should be present
```

## 🎯 What to Look For During Manual Testing

### ✅ Should Work
- Page loads without errors
- Title changes based on user role
- Statistics cards display
- Transaction/receipt cards display
- Amounts in ₱X,XXX.XX format
- Search finds transactions
- Filters reduce results
- Sort changes order
- Expand/collapse animations
- Mobile responsive design

### ❌ Should NOT Happen
- Console errors
- Amounts without commas (e.g., ₱18928.00)
- Amounts in centavos (e.g., ₱1892800.00)
- Missing transaction data
- Broken filters
- Slow API calls (>5 seconds)
- UI breaking on mobile
- Authentication errors after login

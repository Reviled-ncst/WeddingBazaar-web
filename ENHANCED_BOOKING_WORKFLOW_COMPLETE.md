- **Enhanced Notifications**: Clear success/error feedback with next-step guidance
- **Consistent Handling**: Both booking card and quote modal use same enhanced function

### Technical Improvements
- **Dual Approach**: Handles both test bookings and real bookings appropriately
- **Error Resilience**: No longer fails completely when API is unavailable
- **User Feedback**: Rich notifications guide users through workflow steps
- **Local State Sync**: Immediate UI updates while background API calls process
- **Logging Enhanced**: Comprehensive console logging for debugging

## ⚙️ Technical Details

- **No Backend Dependency**: Direct Firebase check

### Why 5 Seconds?
- ⚡ Fast enough to feel instant
- 🔋 Battery-friendly (not too frequent)
- 🌐 Network-efficient

### Clean-up:
- Polling stops when you leave the page
- No memory leaks or background processes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Badge doesn't update after 5 seconds?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify you're logged in to the correct account
3. Try clicking "Send Verification Email" again
4. Check if email was actually verified (check inbox)

### Still shows "Not Verified" after clicking button?
1. Button click should **immediately update** if already verified
2. If not, check console logs for errors
3. Verify Firebase connection (check network tab)

### Button doesn't disappear?
1. Badge should be "Verified ✅" first
2. Wait 5 seconds for next polling cycle
3. Check if `firebaseEmailVerified` state updated (devtools)

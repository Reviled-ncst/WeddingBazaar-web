## üéØ What Was Deployed

### Fixed Issue
- **Problem**: Infinite 404 profile fetch loops for orphaned Firebase accounts
- **Root Cause**: Firebase user created, but backend registration failed
- **Impact**: Users stuck in endless loading state with 1000+ failed API requests

### Solution Deployed
1. **Automatic Orphaned Account Detection**
   - Detects 404 responses from backend profile fetch
   - Tracks detected accounts to prevent re-processing
   - Signs out user immediately

2. **User-Friendly Error Messaging**
   - Clear explanation of what happened
   - Actionable next steps (register with new email)
   - 12-second display with auto-dismiss

3. **Complete Cleanup**
   - Clears all localStorage and sessionStorage
   - Removes cached tokens and user data
   - Resets all auth states

4. **Infinite Loop Prevention**
   - Auth state listener skips detected accounts
   - One-time processing per email
   - Early exit to prevent re-syncing

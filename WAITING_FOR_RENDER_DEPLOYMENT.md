**⏳ WAITING FOR RENDER DEPLOYMENT**

## Current Status

✅ **Code Fixed**: Commit `e64ece0` removes non-existent column update  
✅ **Code Pushed**: GitHub has the latest code  
⏳ **Render Deploying**: Waiting for auto-deployment (~5-10 minutes)  
❌ **Still Getting 500**: Old code is still running on server

---

## Why You're Still Seeing the Error

Render auto-deploys when you push to `main`, but it takes time:

1. **Git Push** (✅ Complete): `547a5fe` pushed to GitHub
2. **Render Detects**: Render webhook detects new commit
3. **Build Phase**: Render runs `npm install` in backend-deploy/
4. **Deploy Phase**: Render restarts the server with new code
5. **Health Check**: Render verifies the new deployment

**Current Step**: Somewhere between steps 2-5 (~5-10 minutes total)

## How to Check if Deployment is Complete

### Method 1: Check Render Dashboard
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Find your service: `weddingbazaar-web`
3. Look for "Deploying..." or "Live" status
4. Wait for green "Live" badge

### Method 2: Check Git Commit in Backend
Run this in your browser console on the app:
```javascript
fetch('https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/health')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log('Version:', d.version, 'Uptime:', d.uptime));
```

If `uptime` is low (< 300 seconds = 5 minutes), it means the server just restarted with new code!

### Method 3: Wait 5-10 Minutes
Just wait and try the upgrade again. The old deployment has been running for **1501 seconds** (25 minutes), so when you see uptime reset to a low number, it's ready.

## What to Do Right Now

### Option 1: Wait and Retry (Recommended)
1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for Render to finish deploying
2. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl + Shift + R to clear cache)
3. **Try the upgrade again** with the same steps

### Option 2: Monitor Deployment
Open Render dashboard and watch the deployment progress:
- https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-csrqgdggph6c73c0s0i0
- Look for "Deploying..." changing to "Live"
- Check deployment logs for any errors

### Option 3: Force Refresh After 10 Minutes
If 10 minutes have passed:
1. Check uptime with health endpoint
2. If still high, manually trigger redeploy in Render dashboard
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"

## How to Know It's Fixed

When the new code is deployed, you'll see:

✅ **Payment succeeds** (this is already working)  
✅ **Subscription upgrade succeeds** (currently failing with 500)  
✅ **Plan changes to "Premium" in your profile**  
✅ **No error message about "subscription upgrade failed"**

## Current Deployment Status

**Last Checked**: October 29, 2025, 1:11 AM  
**Server Uptime**: 1501 seconds (25 minutes) - **OLD DEPLOYMENT**  
**Git Commit on Server**: Probably older than `e64ece0`  
**Latest Commit**: `547a5fe` (includes the fix)

---

## Next Steps

1. **⏰ Wait 10 minutes** (until ~1:20 AM)
2. **🔄 Check Render Dashboard** for deployment status
3. **🔁 Refresh your browser** completely
4. **🧪 Try upgrade again**

**Estimated Ready Time**: ~1:20 AM (in about 8-9 minutes from your last attempt)

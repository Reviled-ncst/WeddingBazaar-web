## üìä Real Data Integration

### CoupleHeader Notifications
**File:** `src/pages/users/individual/landing/CoupleHeader.tsx`

**Before:** Hardcoded notification counts
```tsx
const notifications = 3; // ‚ùå Hardcoded
```

**After:** Real-time API integration
```tsx
const [notificationCount, setNotificationCount] = useState<number>(0);

useEffect(() => {
  const fetchNotificationCount = async () => {
    const result = await notificationService.getUnreadNotifications();
    setNotificationCount(result.count);
  };
  fetchNotificationCount();
}, []);
```

### IndividualBookings Data Flow
**File:** `src/pages/users/individual/bookings/IndividualBookings.tsx`

**API Integration:**
```tsx
// Fetch bookings from backend
const response = await bookingApiService.getClientBookings();
const enhancedBookings = response.map(mapToEnhancedBooking);
```

**Data Mapping:**
- Backend booking object ‚Üí Enhanced booking format
- All fields validated and typed
- Graceful handling of missing/null values
- Date parsing and formatting

## üîç Build Warnings (Non-Critical)

### 1. Large Bundle Size
```
(!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification.
Main bundle: 2,506.33 kB
```

**Impact:** Initial page load may be slower for users on slow connections
**Mitigation Planned:** 
- Code splitting with dynamic imports
- Manual chunk optimization
- Lazy loading for non-critical features

### 2. Missing Exports
```
"Category" is not exported by "src/services/api/categoryService.ts"
"CategoryField" is not exported by "src/services/api/categoryService.ts"
```

**Impact:** Affects AddServiceForm component only (vendor feature)
**Status:** Non-critical, does not affect IndividualBookings deployment
**Action:** Separate fix required for vendor service form

### 3. Dynamic/Static Import Mix
```
(!) firebaseAuthService.ts is both dynamically and statically imported
(!) cloudinaryService.ts is both dynamically and statically imported
```

**Impact:** Module will not move into separate chunk (larger main bundle)
**Status:** Non-critical performance optimization
**Action:** Future refactor to consolidate import strategy

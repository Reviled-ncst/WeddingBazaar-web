**Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYED**  
**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**URL**: https://weddingbazaarph.web.app  
**Build**: `index-UxLkQ3G1.js`

## 🧹 What Was Removed

### Removed from `ProtectedRoute.tsx`

**Before** (10+ console logs per navigation):
```typescript
console.log('🔓 ProtectedRoute: Navigation delay complete');
console.log('🔄 ProtectedRoute: User is authenticated, redirecting from public route');
console.log('🔄 User object:', user);
console.log('🔄 User role:', JSON.stringify(user?.role));
console.log('🔄 Final redirect URL:', userRedirect);
console.log('🚦 getUserLandingPage called with role:', ...);
console.log('🚦 getUserLandingPage user context:', ...);
console.log('🔍 Vendor detection analysis:', ...);
console.log('🔧 Role Detection: User has vendor properties, treating as vendor');
console.log('🔄 Role mapping:', role, '=>', normalizedRole);
console.log('✅ Routing to /individual for couple/individual');
console.log('✅ Routing to /vendor for vendor');
console.log('✅ Routing to /admin for admin');
console.log('⚠️ Unknown role, defaulting to /individual. Role was:', ...);
```

**After** (0 logs):
```typescript
// Clean, silent routing logic
```

---

### Removed from `RoleProtectedRoute.tsx`

**Before** (7+ console logs per route check):
```typescript
console.log('🔧 [RoleProtectedRoute] Complete user object:', JSON.stringify(user, null, 2));
console.log('🔧 [RoleProtectedRoute] User keys:', Object.keys(user || {}));
console.log('🔧 [RoleProtectedRoute] User.role specifically:', user.role, 'type:', typeof user.role);
console.log('🔧 [RoleProtectedRoute] Using user_type field:', actualRole);
console.log('🔧 [RoleProtectedRoute] No role found, defaulting to couple');
console.log('🔒 [RoleProtectedRoute] Role check:', ...);
console.log('🚫 [RoleProtectedRoute] Access denied, redirecting to correct landing page');
```

**After** (0 logs):
```typescript
// Clean, silent role checking
```

## 🎯 What Remains

### ✅ Upgrade Flow Logging (Still Active)

The ultra-detailed upgrade flow logging in `UpgradePrompt.tsx` is **STILL ACTIVE** and **INTENTIONAL**:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 [UpgradePrompt] UPGRADE BUTTON CLICKED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 Plan Details: { planId: "premium", planName: "Premium", ... }
...
```

This logging is **necessary for debugging** the payment modal issue and will remain until that's resolved.

## 📊 Console Output Comparison

### Before This Fix
```
🔧 [RoleProtectedRoute] Complete user object: {...}
🔧 [RoleProtectedRoute] User keys: [...]
🔧 [RoleProtectedRoute] User.role specifically: vendor type: string
🔒 [RoleProtectedRoute] Role check: {...}
🔄 ProtectedRoute: User is authenticated, redirecting from public route
🔄 User object: {...}
🔄 User role: "vendor"
🚦 getUserLandingPage called with role: "vendor" type: string
🚦 getUserLandingPage user context: {...}
🔍 Vendor detection analysis: {...}
🔄 Role mapping: vendor => vendor
✅ Routing to /vendor for vendor
🔧 [RoleProtectedRoute] Complete user object: {...}  ← REPEATS
🔧 [RoleProtectedRoute] User keys: [...]              ← FOREVER
🔧 [RoleProtectedRoute] User.role specifically: ...   ← IN A LOOP
... (repeats 50+ times)
```

### After This Fix
```
(silent routing - no console noise)

🎯 [UpgradePrompt] UPGRADE BUTTON CLICKED  ← Only when user clicks upgrade
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 Plan Details: ...
```

## 🎨 Result

- ✅ **Clean console** - No more routing spam
- ✅ **Upgrade logging intact** - Can still debug payment modal
- ✅ **Better performance** - Less console overhead
- ✅ **Easier debugging** - Only see logs that matter

---

## 🔧 If You Need Routing Logs Again

If you ever need to debug routing issues, you can temporarily re-enable the logs by:

1. Opening `src/router/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
2. Uncommenting the console.log lines
3. Rebuilding with `npm run build`

But for normal operation, the routing should work silently.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the upgrade flow** (logs will appear when clicking "Upgrade")
2. **Enjoy clean console** (no more routing noise)
3. **Debug payment modal** (using the upgrade logs we kept)

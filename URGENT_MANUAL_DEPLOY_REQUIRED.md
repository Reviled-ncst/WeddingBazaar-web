# üö® URGENT: Manual Render Deployment Required

## Problem Identified
Render is **NOT auto-deploying** from GitHub. The latest workaround commit (22b61bb) has been pushed for 15+ minutes but hasn't deployed.

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Code fixed and pushed to GitHub (commit 22b61bb)
- ‚ùå Render still running old code (uptime > 800 seconds)
- ‚ùå Accept Quote still failing with constraint error

## Immediate Solution: Manual Deploy

### Option 1: Render Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Login to your account
3. Find service: **weddingbazaar-web**
4. Click **"Manual Deploy"** button (top right)
5. Select branch: **main**
6. Click **"Deploy"**
7. Wait 3-5 minutes for deployment
8. Test endpoint again

### Option 2: Enable Auto-Deploy
1. Go to Render Dashboard ‚Üí weddingbazaar-web service
2. Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy
3. Enable **"Auto-Deploy"** for branch: main
4. Save settings
5. Click **"Manual Deploy"** to deploy current commit
6. Future pushes will auto-deploy

### Option 3: Deploy Hook (If Available)
If you have a Render deploy hook URL, run:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "YOUR_RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL" -Method POST
```

## Verification After Deploy

### Check Server Restarted:
```powershell
$h = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/health" | ConvertFrom-Json
Write-Host "Uptime: $($h.uptime) seconds"
# Should be < 100 seconds if just deployed
```

### Test Accept Quote Endpoint:
```powershell
try {
  $r = Invoke-WebRequest `
    -Uri "https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/bookings/1760918009/accept-quote" `
    -Method PATCH `
    -Headers @{"Content-Type"="application/json"} `
    -Body '{"acceptance_notes":"test"}' `
    -ErrorAction Stop
  Write-Host "‚úÖ SUCCESS!" -ForegroundColor Green
  $r.Content
} catch {
  $reader = [System.IO.StreamReader]::new($_.Exception.Response.GetResponseStream())
  $error = $reader.ReadToEnd()
  if ($error -notmatch "bookings_status_check") {
    Write-Host "‚úÖ Workaround working!" -ForegroundColor Green
  } else {
    Write-Host "‚ùå Still has constraint error" -ForegroundColor Red
  }
}
```

## Why This Happened
- Render doesn't have auto-deploy enabled for this service
- GitHub pushes don't trigger builds automatically
- Manual deployment required for each code change

## Next Steps After Manual Deploy
1. ‚úÖ Deploy via Render dashboard
2. ‚úÖ Wait for deployment (3-5 min)
3. ‚úÖ Verify server uptime < 100 seconds
4. ‚úÖ Test Accept Quote in browser
5. ‚úÖ Enable auto-deploy to prevent this in future

## Alternative: Wait for Auto-Deploy
If auto-deploy IS enabled but slow:
- Render free tier can take 10-30 minutes to deploy
- Check Render dashboard for deployment status
- Look for "Deploy in Progress" or "Build Failed" messages

## Contact
If you don't have access to Render dashboard:
- Provide deploy hook URL
- Or provide Render account credentials
- Or wait for auto-deploy (if enabled)

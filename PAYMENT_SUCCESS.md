## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

All these are now working:

- ✅ Backend deployed with payment routes
- ✅ PayMongo keys configured
- ✅ Payment health endpoint returns success
- ✅ Test mode enabled
- ✅ Frontend can call payment APIs
- ✅ Receipt generation ready
- ✅ Booking status updates ready

---

## 🔐 SECURITY NOTES

### Current Configuration (TEST MODE)
- Using TEST API keys
- All transactions are simulated
- No real money is charged
- Safe for unlimited testing

### When Switching to LIVE MODE
1. Replace TEST keys with LIVE keys in Render
2. Configure PayMongo webhook URL
3. Test with small amount first
4. Monitor transactions closely
5. Set up proper error alerting

---

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Payment Fails
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify test card number is correct
3. Check backend logs in Render
4. Verify PayMongo keys are correct
5. Ensure booking is in correct status

### Common Issues
- **404 on payment endpoint**: Old code deployed, trigger redeploy
- **PayMongo keys missing**: Check Render environment variables
- **Payment declined**: Use correct test card (4343...)
- **Receipt not generated**: Check backend logs for errors

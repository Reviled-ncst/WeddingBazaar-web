## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:

#### 1. **Email Service** - `backend-deploy/utils/emailService.cjs`
**New Method Added:**
```javascript
async sendNewBookingNotification(vendorData, bookingData)
```

**Parameters:**
- `vendorData`:
  - `email` - Vendor's email address
  - `businessName` - Vendor business name
  - `firstName` - Vendor first name (optional)
  
- `bookingData`:
  - `id` - Booking ID
  - `coupleName` - Couple's name
  - `coupleEmail` - Couple's email
  - `serviceType` - Type of service requested
  - `eventDate` - Event date
  - `eventLocation` - Event location
  - `guestCount` - Number of guests (optional)
  - `budgetRange` - Budget range (optional)
  - `specialRequests` - Special requirements (optional)
  - `createdAt` - Booking creation timestamp

**Features:**
- HTML and plain text versions
- High priority email flag
- Error handling (non-blocking)
- Development mode (logs to console if email not configured)

#### 2. **Bookings Route** - `backend-deploy/routes/bookings.cjs`
**Changes:**
- Added `emailService` import
- Added email notification logic after booking creation
- Fetches vendor email from database
- Sends notification asynchronously (fire-and-forget)
- Error handling to prevent booking failure if email fails

**Code Added:**
```javascript
// Import
const emailService = require('../utils/emailService.cjs');

// After booking creation
try {
  const vendorData = await sql`...fetch vendor email...`;
  
  if (vendorData && vendorData.length > 0 && vendorData[0].email) {
    emailService.sendNewBookingNotification({...}, {...})
      .catch(err => console.error('Email failed:', err.message));
  }
} catch (emailError) {
  console.error('Email error:', emailError.message);
}
```

## 📊 Database Queries

### Vendor Email Lookup:
```sql
SELECT 
  vp.business_name,
  u.email,
  u.first_name
FROM vendor_profiles vp
LEFT JOIN users u ON vp.user_id::text = u.id::text
WHERE vp.id::text = ${vendorId}::text
LIMIT 1
```

This joins `vendor_profiles` with `users` table to get the vendor's email address.

---

## 🔐 Email Configuration

### Environment Variables Required:

**Gmail SMTP** (Default):
```env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
FRONTEND_URL=https://weddingbazaarph.web.app
```

### Gmail App Password Setup:
1. Go to Google Account Settings
2. Security → 2-Step Verification
3. App Passwords → Generate new password
4. Copy the 16-character password
5. Add to `EMAIL_PASS` environment variable

### Alternative Email Providers:
You can use other providers by modifying `nodemailer` configuration in `emailService.cjs`:

**SendGrid:**
```javascript
host: 'smtp.sendgrid.net',
port: 587,
auth: { user: 'apikey', pass: process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY }
```

**AWS SES:**
```javascript
host: 'email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com',
port: 587,
auth: { user: process.env.AWS_SES_USER, pass: process.env.AWS_SES_PASS }
```

# If not configured, add EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS
```

**Check 2: Gmail App Password**

- Ensure 2FA is enabled on Google account
- Generate new app password
- Use 16-character password (no spaces)
```

**Check 3: SMTP Connection**
```bash
# Test connection in Render shell:
node -e "require('./backend-deploy/utils/emailService.cjs').testConnection()"
```

**Check 4: Firewall/Network**
```
- Ensure port 587 (SMTP) is not blocked
- Check Render network restrictions
- Verify Gmail SMTP is accessible
```

### Email in Spam Folder:

**Solutions:**
1. Add sender to contacts
2. Set up SPF/DKIM records (advanced)
3. Use custom domain email (e.g., notifications@weddingbazaar.com)

### Vendor Not Receiving Email:

**Check:**
1. Vendor email exists in database
2. Email address is correct
3. Check spam folder
4. Verify vendor's email provider allows external emails

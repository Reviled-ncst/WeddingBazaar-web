## 📊 BEFORE vs AFTER

### ❌ BEFORE (Broken):
```javascript
// API Response (Missing Completion Data)
{
  "id": 1761577140,
  "status": "fully_paid",  // ❌ Wrong status
  // ❌ NO completion columns
}

// Frontend UI
Badge: "Fully Paid" (blue)
Button: "Mark as Complete" (green, visible) ❌
Status: Shows as fully_paid instead of completed ❌
```

### ✅ AFTER (Fixed):
```javascript
// API Response (Complete Data)
{
  "id": 1761577140,
  "status": "completed",  // ✅ Correct status
  "vendor_completed": true,
  "vendor_completed_at": "2025-10-27T16:21:46.977Z",
  "couple_completed": true,
  "couple_completed_at": "2025-10-27T15:26:53.474Z",
  "fully_completed": true,
  "fully_completed_at": "2025-10-27T16:36:13.782Z"
}

// Frontend UI
Badge: "Completed ✓" (pink with heart icon) ✅
Button: "Mark as Complete" HIDDEN ✅
Status: Correctly shows as completed ✅
```

## 🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED

### Root Cause:
The backend `/api/bookings/couple/:userId` endpoint was **not selecting** completion columns from the database.

### The Fix:
Updated `routes/bookings.cjs` to include 7 missing columns in the SQL SELECT query:

```sql
-- Added these columns:
b.vendor_completed,
b.vendor_completed_at,
b.couple_completed,
b.couple_completed_at,
b.fully_completed,
b.fully_completed_at,
b.completion_notes
```

### Files Changed:
- ✅ `routes/bookings.cjs` (line 310-363)

### Deployment:
- ✅ Committed to git
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Render auto-deployed
- ✅ Verified in production

---

## 🧪 VERIFICATION STEPS COMPLETED

1. ✅ **Database Check**: Confirmed booking is completed in DB
   ```sql
   status = 'completed'
   fully_completed = true
   both parties confirmed
   ```

2. ✅ **API Test**: Confirmed API returns completion columns
   ```bash
   node test-completion-columns-api.mjs
   Result: ALL COLUMNS PRESENT ✅
   ```

3. ✅ **Frontend Ready**: No changes needed - UI code already correct
   - Badge logic: Uses `status === 'completed'` ✅
   - Button logic: Checks completion flags ✅
   - Mapping utility: Handles all completion fields ✅

## 🔍 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### API Endpoint Fixed:

GET /api/bookings/couple/1-2025-001
```

### Response Structure:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bookings": [
    {
      "id": 1761577140,
      "status": "completed",
      "vendor_completed": true,
      "vendor_completed_at": "2025-10-27T16:21:46.977Z",
      "couple_completed": true,
      "couple_completed_at": "2025-10-27T15:26:53.474Z",
      "fully_completed": true,
      "fully_completed_at": "2025-10-27T16:36:13.782Z",

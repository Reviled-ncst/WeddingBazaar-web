  vendor_id: VARCHAR (From frontend)
  title: VARCHAR (From frontend)
  description: TEXT (From frontend)
  category: VARCHAR (From frontend)
  price: DECIMAL (From frontend)
  images: JSONB (Cloudinary URLs)
  featured: BOOLEAN (From frontend)
  is_active: BOOLEAN (From frontend)
  features: JSONB (From frontend)
  location: VARCHAR (From frontend)
  contact_info: JSONB (From frontend)
  tags: JSONB (From frontend)
  keywords: VARCHAR (From frontend)
  created_at: TIMESTAMP (Auto-generated)
  updated_at: TIMESTAMP (Auto-generated)
}
```

### 🎯 Issue Resolution Confirmation

#### Original Problem ❌
```javascript
// Backend was failing with:
INSERT INTO services (..., duration, ...) // ❌ duration column doesn't exist
VALUES (..., ${duration}, ...)           // ❌ Caused SQL error

// Frontend was not handling errors properly:
if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error('Generic error'); // ❌ No specific error handling
}
```

#### Fixed Solution ✅
```javascript
// Backend now works with:
const finalVendorId = vendor_id || vendorId; // ✅ Accepts both formats
const finalTitle = title || name;           // ✅ Flexible field mapping

INSERT INTO services (
  id, vendor_id, title, description, category, price,
  images, features, is_active, featured, location, 
  contact_info, tags, keywords, created_at, updated_at
) VALUES (
  ${serviceId}, ${finalVendorId}, ${finalTitle}, 
  ${description}, ${category}, ${price || 0},
  ${JSON.stringify(images)}, ${JSON.stringify(features)},
  ${is_active}, ${featured}, ${location || ''},
  ${JSON.stringify(contact_info)}, ${JSON.stringify(tags)},
  ${keywords}, NOW(), NOW()
) // ✅ Matches actual database schema

// Frontend now handles:
try {
  await onSubmit(serviceData);
  onClose(); // ✅ Only close on success
} catch (error) {
  setErrors({ submit: error.message }); // ✅ Show specific error
}
```

# Admin Bookings: Budget Range Display - DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE ✅

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION  
**Deployment URL**: https://weddingbazaarph.web.app/admin/bookings

---

## 🎯 Feature Summary

Enhanced the admin bookings management UI to display client budget ranges when booking amounts haven't been set yet. This provides critical context during the quote/negotiation phase.

## 📊 What Changed

### Visual Update
When a booking is in "Pending Quote" state (no final amounts), the UI now shows:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠️  Pending Quote                       │
│ Awaiting vendor pricing and confirmation│
│ ─────────────────────────────────────── │
│ Client Budget Range                     │
│ $1,500 - $3,000                         │ ← NEW!
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: Updated `AdminBookings.tsx` to conditionally display `budgetRange`
- **Backend**: Already supported - sends `budget_range` from database
- **Styling**: Amber theme matching "pending" state design
- **Data Flow**: Database → API → Frontend → UI display

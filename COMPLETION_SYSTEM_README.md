## 📋 What's New?

### For Couples:
When a booking is **fully paid**, you'll see a new green button:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✓ Mark as Complete                 │
│ (Green button with checkmark icon) │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Click it to**:
1. Confirm the service was delivered satisfactorily
2. Mark your side as complete
3. Wait for vendor to also confirm
4. Once both confirm → Booking becomes "Completed ✓"

---

## 🔄 How It Works

```
Booking Fully Paid
       ↓
You mark as complete → [Waiting for Vendor]
       ↓
Vendor marks complete → [Completed ✓]
       ↓
Both can now leave reviews
```

**Two-Sided Confirmation**:
- You confirm ✅ + Vendor confirms ✅ = Fully Completed 🎉
- One side only = "Awaiting confirmation" status
- Protection for both parties

2. **Go to** "Bookings" page
3. **Find** any booking with "Fully Paid" status

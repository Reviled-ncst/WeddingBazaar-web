# Booking Calendar Fixed - Now Shows Real Booking Data ‚úÖ

## Problem Identified
The calendar in the public service preview was showing **vendor off-day management** (all green with "Quick Actions" instructions), instead of showing **actual booking availability** (red for booked dates, green for available dates).

## Root Cause
The ServicePreview was using `VendorAvailabilityCalendar`, which is designed for **vendor management** (setting off-days), NOT for **public booking display**.

## Solution: Created New PublicBookingCalendar Component

### New Component: `PublicBookingCalendar.tsx`
Location: `src/shared/components/calendar/PublicBookingCalendar.tsx`

**Purpose:** Display-only calendar that fetches and shows real booking data from the database.

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Fetches real booking data via `bookingAvailabilityService`
- ‚úÖ Shows dates with bookings as **RED** (with X icon)
- ‚úÖ Shows available dates as **GREEN** (with checkmark)
- ‚úÖ Displays booking count badge on booked dates
- ‚úÖ Month navigation (previous/next)
- ‚úÖ Highlights today's date with rose ring
- ‚úÖ Read-only (no date selection)

### Calendar Data Flow

```typescript
1. Component loads ‚Üí calls loadCalendarData()
2. Generates date range for current month
3. Calls API: bookingAvailabilityService.getVendorCalendarView(vendorId, startDate, endDate)
4. API fetches: GET /api/bookings/vendor/{vendorId}
5. Receives booking data from database
6. Processes each date:
   - status: 'available' | 'partially_booked' | 'fully_booked' | 'off_day'
   - bookingCount: number of bookings on that date
7. Renders calendar:
   - Red background + X icon = booked dates
   - Green background + checkmark = available dates
   - Count badge = number of bookings
```

### Visual Indicators

**Date Status Colors:**
```tsx
// Booked dates (fully_booked, partially_booked, off_day)
bg-red-100 border-2 border-red-400
+ X icon (red)
+ Count badge (red circle with number)

// Available dates
bg-green-100 border-2 border-green-400
+ Checkmark icon (green)

// Today's date
ring-2 ring-rose-500 (pink ring around date)
```

### Code Comparison

**OLD (Wrong Calendar):**
```tsx
<VendorAvailabilityCalendar
  vendorId={service.vendor_id}
  onDateSelect={(date, availability) => {
    console.log('Selected date:', date, 'Availability:', availability);
  }}
/>
```
‚ùå Shows vendor off-day management UI
‚ùå All dates show as green (available)
‚ùå No booking data displayed

**NEW (Correct Calendar):**
```tsx
<PublicBookingCalendar
  vendorId={service.vendor_id}
  serviceId={service.id}
  className="w-full"
/>
```
‚úÖ Shows real booking data from database
‚úÖ Red dates = booked
‚úÖ Green dates = available
‚úÖ Displays booking counts

## Database Integration

### API Endpoint Used:
```
GET /api/bookings/vendor/{vendorId}
```

### Vendor ID Mapping:
The service automatically handles vendor ID mapping:
- `2-2025-001` ‚Üí maps to `2` (where booking data exists)
- Other IDs ‚Üí used as-is

### Booking Status Detection:
```typescript
status: 'available'        ‚Üí Green (no bookings)
status: 'partially_booked' ‚Üí Red (1+ bookings, under limit)
status: 'fully_booked'     ‚Üí Red (maximum bookings reached)
status: 'off_day'          ‚Üí Red (vendor off day)
```

## Console Logging

The new component provides detailed logging:
```javascript
üìÖ [PublicCalendar] Loading bookings: {vendorId, serviceId, startStr, endStr}
üìä [PublicCalendar] Received calendar data: [...]
```

This helps debug if bookings aren't showing correctly.

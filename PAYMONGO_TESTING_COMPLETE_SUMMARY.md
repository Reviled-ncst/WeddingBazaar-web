## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your PayMongo Test Keys (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://dashboard.paymongo.com/developers/api-keys
2. Toggle to **Test Mode** (top right)
3. Copy your keys:
   - **Secret Key:** `sk_test_...`
   - **Public Key:** `pk_test_...`

### Step 2: Add Keys to Your Environment (1 minute)

Open `.env` and `.env.development` files and replace the placeholders:

```bash
# Replace these placeholders with your actual test keys:
PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_[REDACTED]_actual_key_here
PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_[REDACTED]_actual_key_here
VITE_PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_[REDACTED]_actual_key_here
VITE_PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_[REDACTED]_actual_key_here
```

### Step 3: Start Testing (2 minutes)

```powershell
# Restart development server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run the integration test
node test-paymongo-integration.js
```

Then open: http://localhost:5173/paymongo-test

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: "PayMongo secret key not configured"

**Cause:** Environment variables not loaded

**Fix:**
```powershell
# 1. Verify .env file has keys
cat .env | Select-String "PAYMONGO"

# 2. Restart backend server
cd backend-deploy
npm run dev

# 3. Check environment in backend logs
# Should see: "Secret Key: ✅ Available"
```

### Problem: Payment modal doesn't open

**Cause:** Frontend not running or button not connected

**Fix:**
```powershell
# 1. Check if frontend is running
# Open: http://localhost:5173

# 2. Check console for errors
# Press F12 → Console tab

# 3. Try test page instead
# Open: http://localhost:5173/paymongo-test
```

### Problem: Card payment fails with "Invalid card"

**Cause:** Wrong test card or typo

**Fix:**
- Double-check card number: `4343 4343 4343 4343`
- Verify expiry is in future: `12/34`
- Confirm CVC is 3 digits: `123`
- Try alternative success card: `4120 0000 0000 0007`

### Problem: Payment succeeds but no receipt

**Cause:** Receipt generator not called

**Fix:**
```powershell
# 1. Check backend logs for errors
cd backend-deploy
npm run dev

# 2. Verify database connection
node -e "console.log(process.env.DATABASE_URL ? 'DB Connected' : 'DB Missing')"

# 3. Check receipt table exists
# Connect to Neon dashboard and verify receipts table
```

- Check receipt numbering

### 4. Deploy to Production
- Add live PayMongo keys to Render
- Test with live test keys first
- Switch to production keys when ready
- Monitor payment logs

---

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Backend (Render)
```
□ Add PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY to environment
□ Add PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY to environment
□ Restart backend service
□ Verify /api/payment/health returns 200
□ Test payment with test card
```

### Frontend (Firebase)
```
□ Add VITE_PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY to build config
□ Rebuild and redeploy
□ Test payment flow in production
□ Monitor browser console for errors
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always Use Test Keys First**
   - Test keys start with `sk_test_` and `pk_test_`
   - Live keys for production only!

2. **Check Console Logs**
   - Frontend: Browser DevTools (F12)
   - Backend: Terminal output
   - Both show detailed payment flow

3. **Use Test Page for Quick Tests**
   - Faster than full booking flow
   - Isolated testing environment
   - Clear success/error indicators

4. **Verify Database After Each Test**
   - Check `receipts` table for new entries
   - Check `payments` table for records
   - Verify booking status updates

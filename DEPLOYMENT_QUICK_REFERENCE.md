2. Click any "Premium" button (crown icon)

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

**Before**: Clicking "Upgrade" did nothing ❌  
**After**: Payment modal appears instantly ✅

**Root Causes**:
1. React state updates weren't syncing properly
2. UpgradePrompt was closing before payment modal could render

**Solutions**:
1. Wrapped state updates in `requestAnimationFrame()`
2. Added protection to prevent closing during payment

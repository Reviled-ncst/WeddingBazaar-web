## 🔌 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| GET | `/api/wallet/:vendorId` | Get wallet summary & stats |
| GET | `/api/wallet/:vendorId/transactions` | Get transaction history |
| POST | `/api/wallet/:vendorId/withdraw` | Request withdrawal |
| GET | `/api/wallet/:vendorId/export` | Export to CSV |

All endpoints require JWT authentication.

## 💾 Database Integration

### Data Sources

**Receipts Table** (`receipts`)
```sql
SELECT 
  r.receipt_number,
  r.amount_paid,        -- In centavos
  r.payment_method,
  r.payment_date,
  r.paymongo_payment_id
FROM receipts r
WHERE r.vendor_id = :vendorId
```

**Bookings Table** (`bookings`)
```sql
SELECT *
FROM bookings
WHERE vendor_id = :vendorId
  AND status = 'completed'
  AND fully_completed = true
  AND vendor_completed = true
  AND couple_completed = true
```

### Completion Requirements

For funds to be available:
- ✅ Booking status = 'completed'
- ✅ `fully_completed` = true
- ✅ `vendor_completed` = true (vendor confirmed)
- ✅ `couple_completed` = true (couple confirmed)

---

## 🔐 Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ JWT token required for all endpoints
- ✅ Vendor ID validation (users can only access their own wallet)
- ✅ Role-based access control

### Financial Security
- ✅ Amount validation (positive numbers only)
- ✅ Balance verification before withdrawal
- ✅ SQL injection prevention
- ✅ Input sanitization

### Audit Trail
- ✅ All transactions logged
- ✅ Withdrawal requests tracked
- ✅ Payment references stored
- ✅ Timestamps on all operations

---

## 📊 Business Logic

### Balance Calculation

**Total Earnings**:
```
SUM(receipt.amount_paid) for all completed bookings
```

**Available Balance**:
```
Total Earnings - Withdrawn Amount
```

**Pending Balance**:
```
SUM(receipt.amount_paid) for fully_paid but not completed bookings
```

### Withdrawal Rules

1. Amount must be > 0
2. Amount must be ≤ Available Balance
3. Valid payment method required
4. Account details must be provided
5. Admin approval required (manual process)

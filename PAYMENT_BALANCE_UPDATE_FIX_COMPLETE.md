# üéØ Payment Balance Update - Complete Fix

## Problem Analysis

### Issue 1: Balance Not Updating After Payment
**Symptom:**
- User pays deposit: ‚Ç±26,881 ‚úÖ Payment succeeds
- UI shows "Deposit Paid" badge ‚úÖ Correct
- **BUT** Balance still shows: ‚Ç±89,603.36 ‚ùå Should be reduced!
- Payment history shows the payment ‚úÖ Correct

**Root Cause:**
The backend `/api/payment/process` endpoint correctly:
1. ‚úÖ Creates receipt in `receipts` table
2. ‚úÖ Updates booking status to `downpayment` or `fully_paid`
3. ‚úÖ Sets `total_paid`, `remaining_balance`, `payment_progress` fields

**BUT** the frontend is NOT displaying these updated values correctly because:
1. The `BookingCard` component uses `booking.amount` as total
2. After payment, backend updates `total_paid` and `remaining_balance`
3. Frontend needs to calculate: `displayBalance = booking.amount - booking.total_paid`

### Issue 2: Full Payment Option Missing
**Symptom:**
- Only "Pay Deposit" and "Pay Balance" buttons exist
- No "Pay Full Amount" option for users who want to pay everything upfront

**Root Cause:**
- Backend has full payment logic in `/api/payment/process` (paymentType: 'full')
- Frontend `BookingActions.tsx` has `onPayFull` handler defined
- BUT the button is not properly implemented or connected

## Database Schema Verification

### Bookings Table - Required Columns
```sql
-- Payment tracking columns (should exist)
total_amount INTEGER,              -- Total booking cost in centavos
deposit_amount INTEGER,            -- Expected deposit (30% of total)
total_paid INTEGER DEFAULT 0,      -- Running total of all payments
remaining_balance INTEGER,         -- Amount left to pay
downpayment_amount INTEGER,        -- Actual deposit paid
payment_progress INTEGER DEFAULT 0, -- Percentage (0-100)
last_payment_date TIMESTAMP,       -- Last payment timestamp
payment_method VARCHAR(50),        -- 'card', 'gcash', 'paymaya', etc.
transaction_id VARCHAR(255),       -- PayMongo reference
```

### Receipts Table - Structure (CONFIRMED)
```sql
CREATE TABLE receipts (
  id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
  booking_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  couple_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  vendor_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  amount_paid INTEGER NOT NULL,      -- Amount of THIS payment
  total_amount INTEGER NOT NULL,     -- Total booking amount
  tax_amount INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  payment_method VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'online',
  payment_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'completed',
  receipt_number VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  transaction_reference VARCHAR(100),
  payment_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  description TEXT,
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Complete Fix Implementation

### Fix 1: Update Frontend to Display Correct Balance

**File:** `src/pages/users/individual/bookings/IndividualBookings.tsx`

**Current Logic:**
```typescript
// Shows full amount, doesn't subtract payments
totalAmount: booking.amount
remainingBalance: booking.amount
```

**Fixed Logic:**
```typescript
// Calculate actual remaining balance
const totalPaid = booking.total_paid || 0;
const totalAmount = booking.amount || booking.total_amount || 0;
const remainingBalance = totalAmount - totalPaid;
```

### Fix 2: Ensure Backend Returns All Payment Fields

**File:** `backend-deploy/routes/bookings.cjs`

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/bookings/user/:userId`

**Ensure Returns:**
```javascript
{
  id, status, amount, total_amount,
  total_paid,              // ‚Üê Must return this
  remaining_balance,       // ‚Üê Must return this
  downpayment_amount,      // ‚Üê Must return this
  payment_progress,        // ‚Üê Must return this
  last_payment_date,       // ‚Üê Must return this
  payment_method,          // ‚Üê Must return this
  transaction_id           // ‚Üê Must return this
}
```

### Fix 3: Add Full Payment Button

**File:** `src/pages/users/individual/bookings/components/BookingActions.tsx`

**Add Button:**
```typescript
{/* Full Payment Option */}
{(status === 'quote_accepted' || status === 'deposit_paid') && (
  <button
    onClick={() => onPayFull?.(booking)}
    className="px-4 py-2 bg-green-600 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-green-700"
  >
    üí∞ Pay Full Amount
  </button>
)}
```

### Fix 4: Connect Full Payment Modal

**File:** `src/pages/users/individual/bookings/IndividualBookings.tsx`

**Add Handler:**
```typescript
const handlePayFull = (booking: Booking) => {
  const totalAmount = booking.amount || booking.total_amount || 0;
  const totalPaid = booking.total_paid || 0;
  const remainingBalance = totalAmount - totalPaid;

  setSelectedPayment({
    bookingId: booking.id,
    amount: remainingBalance, // Pay whatever is left
    paymentType: 'full',
    booking
  });
  setIsPaymentModalOpen(true);
};
```

---

## Payment Flow Verification

### Current Flow (Deposit Payment)
```
1. User clicks "Pay Deposit" ‚Üí Opens PayMongoPaymentModal
2. User enters card details ‚Üí createCardPayment()
3. Backend processes:
   POST /api/payment/process
   {
     bookingId: "xxx",
     paymentType: "deposit",
     amount: 26881, // centavos
     paymentMethod: "card",
     paymentReference: "pi_xxx"
   }

4. Backend executes:
   - Creates receipt in receipts table ‚úÖ
   - Updates booking:
     SET status = 'downpayment',
         downpayment_amount = 26881,
         total_paid = 26881,
         remaining_balance = 62722, // (89603 - 26881)
         payment_progress = 30,
         last_payment_date = NOW()

5. Frontend receives success ‚úÖ
6. Frontend calls fetchBookings() ‚úÖ
7. **PROBLEM:** BookingCard still shows full amount ‚ùå
```

### Fixed Flow
```
7. ‚úÖ BookingCard now calculates:
   displayBalance = booking.amount - booking.total_paid
   = 89603 - 26881 = 62722 ‚úÖ CORRECT!
```

## Database Queries for Verification

### Check Booking After Payment
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  status,
  amount as total_cost,
  total_paid,
  remaining_balance,
  payment_progress,
  downpayment_amount,
  last_payment_date,
  payment_method
FROM bookings
WHERE id = 'your-booking-id';
```

### Check Receipts for Booking
```sql
SELECT 
  receipt_number,
  amount_paid,
  payment_method,
  transaction_reference,
  payment_date,
  description
FROM receipts
WHERE booking_id = 'your-booking-id'
ORDER BY created_at ASC;
```

### Verify Payment Totals Match
```sql
SELECT 
  b.id,
  b.total_paid as booking_total_paid,
  SUM(r.amount_paid) as receipts_total,
  b.total_paid - SUM(r.amount_paid) as discrepancy
FROM bookings b
LEFT JOIN receipts r ON r.booking_id = b.id
WHERE b.id = 'your-booking-id'
GROUP BY b.id, b.total_paid;
```

## Code Changes Required

### 1. IndividualBookings.tsx
```typescript
// Add balance calculation
const calculateBalance = (booking: Booking) => {
  const total = booking.amount || booking.total_amount || 0;
  const paid = booking.total_paid || 0;
  return Math.max(0, total - paid);
};

// Pass to BookingCard
<BookingCard
  booking={{
    ...booking,
    remainingBalance: calculateBalance(booking)
  }}
/>
```

### 2. BookingActions.tsx
```typescript
// Add full payment button
{(status === 'quote_accepted' || status === 'deposit_paid') && onPayFull && (
  <button

  >
    <span>üí∞</span>
    <span>Pay Full Amount</span>
  </button>
)}
```

### 3. Backend - Ensure Columns Exist
```sql
-- If columns missing, add them
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS total_paid INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

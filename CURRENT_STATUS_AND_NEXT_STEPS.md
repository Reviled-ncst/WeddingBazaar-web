## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTIONABLE TASKS (Next 30 Minutes)

### üö® CRITICAL: SIMPLIFY USER EXPERIENCE FOR NORMAL USERS

**PROBLEM**: The platform has become too complex for normal users. We need to streamline the core user flows.

#### Task 1: Simplify Homepage Navigation
**Current Issue**: Too many options, complex terminology, overwhelming for couples planning their wedding.

**Solution**: Create a simple 3-step process:
```
1. "Find Wedding Vendors" (simple search)
2. "Get Recommendations" (DSS simplified)  
3. "Book Your Vendors" (streamlined booking)
```

#### Task 2: Simplify Service Discovery
**Current Issue**: 90+ services, complex filtering, overwhelming categories.

**Solution**: Group into 5 essential categories:
```
1. üì∏ Photography & Video
2. üçΩÔ∏è Food & Catering  
3. üéµ Music & Entertainment
4. üíê Flowers & Decoration
5. üìã Planning & Coordination
```

#### Task 3: Simplify DSS (Decision Support System)
**Current Issue**: "Decision Support System" sounds technical and complicated.

**Solution**: Rename and simplify:
```
OLD: "Decision Support System with batch booking and group chat"
NEW: "Get My Wedding Plan" - Simple recommendations with easy booking
```

#### Task 4: Simplify User Dashboard
**Current Issue**: 13 pages, too many options, confusing navigation.

**Solution**: Reduce to 5 essential pages:
```
1. My Wedding (main dashboard)
2. Find Vendors (search & browse)
3. My Bookings (confirmed vendors)
4. Messages (vendor chat)
5. My Profile (settings)
```

#### Task 5: Simplify Booking Process
**Current Issue**: Complex booking modals, technical terms, multiple steps.

**Solution**: Simple 2-step booking:
```
Step 1: "Contact [Vendor Name]" (sends message)
Step 2: "Book This Vendor" (confirms booking)
```

### Task 1: Vendor Landing Page Creation
Create the vendor dashboard structure that mirrors the individual user module:

```
src/pages/users/vendor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ landing/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ VendorLanding.tsx      # Main vendor dashboard
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ VendorHeader.tsx       # Vendor-specific header
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts               # Export file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard/                 # Vendor analytics
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profile/                   # Business profile management  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bookings/                  # Client booking management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ messages/                  # Client messaging
```

### Task 2: Admin Landing Page Creation
Create the admin panel structure for platform management:

```
src/pages/users/admin/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ landing/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AdminLanding.tsx       # Main admin dashboard
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AdminHeader.tsx        # Admin-specific header
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts               # Export file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ users/                     # User management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vendors/                   # Vendor approval system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analytics/                 # Platform analytics
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bookings/                  # System-wide booking oversight
```

### Task 3: Router Enhancement ‚úÖ COMPLETED
Updated the AppRouter to use SimplifiedHomepage instead of the complex Homepage:

# 🎊 SUCCESS: Infinite Render Loop FIXED!

## Date: October 29, 2025, 3:45 PM

## ✅ PROBLEM SOLVED

The **infinite render loop** causing console spam in the Services page has been **completely fixed** and **deployed to production**.

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before Fix:
```
🔴 Console Output:
🎯 [Services] *** SERVICES COMPONENT RENDERED ***
🎯 [Services] *** SERVICES COMPONENT RENDERED ***
🎯 [Services] *** SERVICES COMPONENT RENDERED ***
... (repeated 100+ times)
```

### After Fix:
```
✅ Console Output:
(clean, no spam logs)
```

## 🔧 Technical Fix

**Changed**: `useEffect` with `setState` → `useMemo` with computed value

**File**: `src/pages/users/individual/services/Services_Centralized.tsx`

**Before**:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const filtered = services.filter(...);
  setFilteredServices(filtered); // ❌ Causes re-render
}, [services, filters]);
```

**After**:
```typescript
const filteredServices = useMemo(() => {
  return services.filter(...); // ✅ Computed, no state update
}, [services, filters]);
```

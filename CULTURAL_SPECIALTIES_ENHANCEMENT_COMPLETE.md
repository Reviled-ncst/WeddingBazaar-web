### 3. **Advanced Analytics Tracking**

Created a comprehensive analytics utility (`src/utils/analytics.ts`) with:

#### Core Features
- Event tracking for all user interactions
- Automatic metadata collection (timestamps, user IDs, service categories)
- Event queue management with automatic cleanup
- Development mode console logging
- Production-ready analytics integration points

#### Tracked Events
```typescript
// Cultural specialty selection
analytics.trackCulturalSpecialty({
  specialty: 'Filipino',
  action: 'added',
  totalSelected: 3,
  serviceCategory: 'Photography',
  vendorId: 'vendor-123'
});

// Wedding style selection
analytics.trackWeddingStyle({
  style: 'Modern',
  action: 'added',
  totalSelected: 2,
  serviceCategory: 'Photography',
  vendorId: 'vendor-123'
});

// Service tier selection
analytics.trackServiceTier({
  tier: 'Premium',
  serviceCategory: 'Photography',
  vendorId: 'vendor-123'
});

// Availability calendar usage
analytics.trackAvailabilityCalendar({
  action: 'opened',
  datesSelected: 15,
  vendorId: 'vendor-123'
});
```

#### Business Insights
The analytics utility can generate insights such as:
- Most popular cultural specialties
- Most popular wedding styles
- Average number of specialties selected per vendor
- Average number of styles selected per vendor
- Service tier distribution

### 4. **Selection Management**

#### Selection Counter
Both sections now display the current selection count:
```tsx
<label>
  <span>Cultural Specialties</span>
  <span className="text-xs text-gray-500 ml-2">
    ({formData.cultural_specialties.length} selected)
  </span>
</label>
```

#### Clear All Button
Quick way to deselect all options:
```tsx
{formData.cultural_specialties.length > 0 && (
  <button
    onClick={() => setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, cultural_specialties: [] }))}
  >
    Clear all
  </button>
)}
```

### 5. **Improved Accessibility**

#### Enhanced ARIA Labels
```tsx
<input
  type="checkbox"
  aria-label={`${specialty.value} - ${specialty.tooltip}`}
  // ...
/>
```

#### Title Attributes
All option cards now have title attributes for browser tooltips:
```tsx
<label title={specialty.tooltip}>
  {/* Card content */}
</label>
```

#### Screen Reader Support
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper label associations
- Hidden checkbox inputs with sr-only class
- Visual feedback for selected states

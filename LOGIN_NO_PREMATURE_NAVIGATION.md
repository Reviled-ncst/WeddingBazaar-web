# 🚨 LOGIN ISSUE: Premature Page Reload

## Problem
The page reloads/navigates BEFORE login validation completes, causing:
- Modal closes before error shows
- User sees homepage reload instead of error message
- Bad UX - looks like the app is broken

## Root Cause
Looking at the logs:
```
❌ [LoginModal] Login FAILED - keeping modal open
🔒 [LoginModal] Error: Firebase: Error (auth/invalid-credential).
📍 [LoginModal] Modal should stay open with error UI
🔍 Fetching services from: https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com <-- PAGE RELOADED!
```

**The page is reloading even though the error was caught correctly.**

## What's Happening

1. User clicks "Sign In"
2. LoginModal calls `login(email, password)`
3. Auth context starts Firebase validation
4. **SOMETHING triggers a page reload/navigation** ❌
5. Error is thrown but modal is already gone
6. User sees homepage instead of error

## Hypothesis
The `login` function in HybridAuthContext.tsx might be:
- Calling `setUser()` prematurely
- Triggering a navigation before validation completes
- Causing a state update that forces re-render

## Solution Needed
**Don't do ANYTHING until credentials are validated:**

1. ✅ Validate credentials with Firebase
2. ✅ If invalid → throw error immediately (no state changes)
3. ✅ If valid → THEN sync with backend
4. ✅ THEN update user state
5. ✅ THEN allow navigation

### Current Flow (WRONG)
```
Click Login
  → Call Firebase
  → Start backend sync (triggers state updates)
  → Page reloads
  → Error thrown (but user already navigated)
```

### Correct Flow (NEEDED)
```
Click Login
  → Call Firebase
  → Wait for validation
  → If error → throw immediately (no state changes)
  → If success → sync backend → update state → navigate
```

## Files to Check
1. `src/shared/contexts/HybridAuthContext.tsx` - login function
   - Check where `setUser()` is called
   - Check where `setIsLoading()` is called
   - Make sure NO state updates happen before validation

2. `src/shared/components/modals/LoginModal.tsx` - already correct
   - Error handling is good
   - Modal staying open is good
   - Just needs the auth context to not trigger navigation

## Next Steps
1. Review `login()` function in HybridAuthContext
2. Ensure `setUser()` is ONLY called after successful validation
3. Ensure no navigation/reload triggers before validation completes
4. Test with wrong credentials - page should NOT reload

**Status**: DIAGNOSED - Need to fix HybridAuthContext login flow
**Priority**: HIGH - This breaks the entire login UX

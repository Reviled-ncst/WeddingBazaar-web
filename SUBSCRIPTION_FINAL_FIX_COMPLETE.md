**Deployment**: ✅ Frontend deployed to Firebase

## 🐛 Root Causes Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Wrong Vendor ID Format in Upgrade Call
**Location**: `src/pages/users/vendor/services/VendorServices.tsx` (Line 2309)

**Problem**:
```typescript
// WRONG - Sending UUID format
vendor_id: user?.vendorId  // "daf1dd71-b5c7-44a1-bf88-36d41e73a7fa"
```

**Fix**:
```typescript
// CORRECT - Sending user ID format
vendor_id: user?.id  // "2-2025-003"
```

**Why this matters**: The backend subscription table uses `vendor_id` in the format `2-2025-003`, not the UUID format. When we sent the UUID, it created a subscription for a non-existent vendor ID.

---

### Issue 2: Missing /api/ Prefix in Subscription Fetch
**Location**: `src/shared/contexts/SubscriptionContext.tsx` (Line 82)

**Problem**:
```typescript
// WRONG - Missing /api/ prefix
const response = await fetch(`${apiUrl}/subscriptions/vendor/${user.id}`);
// Was calling: https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/subscriptions/vendor/2-2025-003
```

**Fix**:
```typescript
// CORRECT - Added /api/ prefix
const response = await fetch(`${apiUrl}/api/subscriptions/vendor/${user.id}`);
// Now calls: https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/subscriptions/vendor/2-2025-003
```

**Why this matters**: Without the `/api/` prefix, the subscription fetch was hitting a non-existent route (404), causing the SubscriptionContext to fall back to the FREE TIER (basic plan) every time. This is why even after upgrade, it still showed 5 services limit and "Premium" as the recommended plan.

## 📊 What Was Broken

### Before Fixes
1. **Upgrade succeeded** ✅ (but for wrong vendor ID)
2. **Database updated** ✅ (but with UUID vendor_id like `daf1dd71-b5c7-44a1-bf88-36d41e73a7fa`)
3. **Subscription fetch failed** ❌ (404 error due to missing `/api/`)
4. **Fallback to FREE TIER** ❌ (always showed basic plan)
5. **Service limit still 5** ❌ (because it was using basic plan)
6. **Modal still showed Premium** ❌ (because current plan was detected as basic)

### After Fixes
1. **Upgrade sends correct vendor ID** ✅ (`2-2025-003`)
2. **Database updated with correct ID** ✅
3. **Subscription fetch succeeds** ✅ (correct URL with `/api/`)
4. **Real subscription loaded** ✅ (no more fallback)
5. **Correct service limits** ✅ (unlimited for premium/pro)
6. **Modal shows correct upgrade path** ✅

## 🔍 Evidence from Console Logs

### The Smoking Gun
```
🔧 [SubscriptionContext] Providing FREE TIER fallback (basic) due to error
```

This log appeared **every time** because the subscription fetch was failing (404). The SubscriptionContext was designed to provide a fallback to basic plan when the API call fails, which is why the upgrade "succeeded" but nothing changed.

### User Object Structure
```javascript
{
  "id": "2-2025-003",                              // ✅ Correct format for vendor_id
  "vendorId": "daf1dd71-b5c7-44a1-bf88-36d41e73a7fa",  // ❌ Wrong - this is UUID
  "role": "vendor",
  "email": "elealesantos06@gmail.com",
  "businessName": "Boutique"
}
```

The code was using `user?.vendorId` (UUID) when it should have been using `user?.id` (user ID format).

---

## ✅ Files Changed

### 1. VendorServices.tsx
**Line 2309**: Changed vendor ID in upgrade API call
```diff
- vendor_id: user?.vendorId,  // UUID format
+ vendor_id: user?.id,         // User ID format
```

### 2. SubscriptionContext.tsx
**Line 82**: Added `/api/` prefix to subscription fetch URL
```diff
- const response = await fetch(`${apiUrl}/subscriptions/vendor/${user.id}`);
+ const response = await fetch(`${apiUrl}/api/subscriptions/vendor/${user.id}`);
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test the Fix
1. **Clear old subscription data**:
   - Open browser DevTools → Application tab
   - Clear all storage/cookies for the site
   - Refresh the page

2. **Login as vendor**:
   - Email: elealesantos06@gmail.com
   - Login and go to VendorServices page

3. **Check console for subscription fetch**:
   - Should see: `✅ [SubscriptionContext] Subscription loaded: basic` (or premium if upgraded)
   - Should NOT see: `🔧 [SubscriptionContext] Providing FREE TIER fallback`

4. **Try to create 6th service**:
   - If on basic plan: Modal should open
   - Click "Upgrade Plan"
   - Select "Premium" plan
   - Click "Upgrade" button

5. **Verify upgrade succeeds**:
   - Should see success alert
   - Page should reload
   - Check console: Should show `✅ [SubscriptionContext] Subscription loaded: premium`
   - Service limit should change to "Unlimited"
   - Try creating another service - should succeed without modal

6. **Verify modal state**:
   - If you open the upgrade modal again, it should now recommend "Professional" or "Enterprise" (not Premium)
   - This confirms the system knows you're on Premium plan

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Subscription Flow
```
1. User logs in
   ↓
2. SubscriptionContext fetches: GET /api/subscriptions/vendor/2-2025-003
   ↓
3. Backend returns current subscription (basic/premium/pro/enterprise)
   ↓
4. Frontend uses actual subscription data (no fallback)
   ↓
5. Service limits match subscription plan
   ↓
6. Upgrade modal shows correct plan recommendations
```

### Upgrade Flow
```
1. User clicks "Upgrade Plan"
   ↓
2. Frontend sends: PUT /api/subscriptions/upgrade
   Body: { vendor_id: "2-2025-003", new_plan: "premium" }
   ↓
3. Backend creates/updates subscription in database
   With correct vendor_id: "2-2025-003"
   ↓
4. Frontend receives success response
   ↓
5. Page reloads
   ↓
6. SubscriptionContext fetches updated subscription
   ↓
7. New limits take effect immediately
   ↓
8. User can create unlimited services (if premium/pro/enterprise)
```

## 📝 Database Verification

### Check Subscription in Database
```sql
-- Check if subscription exists with correct vendor_id
SELECT * FROM vendor_subscriptions 
WHERE vendor_id = '2-2025-003'
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;

-- Should show:
-- vendor_id: '2-2025-003' (NOT the UUID!)
-- plan_id: 'premium' (or whichever plan was selected)
-- plan_name: 'premium'
-- status: 'active'
```

### Clean Up Old Wrong Subscriptions (if needed)
```sql
-- Remove subscriptions with UUID vendor_id (wrong format)
DELETE FROM vendor_subscriptions 
WHERE vendor_id LIKE '%-%-%-%-%'  -- UUID format
AND vendor_id NOT LIKE '%-%-%'    -- But not user ID format
AND LENGTH(vendor_id) > 20;       -- UUID is 36 chars, user ID is ~10 chars
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Still Showing Basic Plan After Upgrade

**Check 1**: Verify subscription fetch URL
```javascript
// In browser console, look for this log:
🔔 [SubscriptionContext] Fetching subscription for vendor: 2-2025-003

// Then check the Network tab for the request
// Should be: /api/subscriptions/vendor/2-2025-003 (with /api/)
```

**Check 2**: Verify vendor_id in upgrade request
```javascript
// In Network tab, check the upgrade request body:
{
  "vendor_id": "2-2025-003",  // Should be this format
  "new_plan": "premium"
}

// NOT:
{
  "vendor_id": "daf1dd71-b5c7-44a1-bf88-36d41e73a7fa",  // UUID = wrong!
  "new_plan": "premium"
}
```

**Check 3**: Clear browser cache
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Or clear all site data in DevTools

**Check 4**: Check database directly
```sql
SELECT * FROM vendor_subscriptions WHERE vendor_id = '2-2025-003';
```

## 📚 Related Issues This Fixes

5. ✅ Subscription fetch returning 404 errors
6. ✅ Database having subscriptions with wrong vendor_id format

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### 1. Always Check the Full URL Path
The missing `/api/` prefix was causing a 404, but the error was silently caught and fell back to the basic plan. Always verify the complete URL in network requests.

### 2. Understand Your Data Model
The system has TWO different ID formats:
- **User ID**: `2-2025-003` (used in subscription table)
- **Vendor UUID**: `daf1dd71-b5c7-44a1-bf88-36d41e73a7fa` (used in vendor table)

Using the wrong one creates orphaned records.

### 3. Check Fallback Behavior
The SubscriptionContext had a helpful fallback to basic plan on error, but this masked the real issue (404 errors). Always check WHY fallbacks are being triggered.

### 4. Console Logs Are Your Friend
The log `🔧 [SubscriptionContext] Providing FREE TIER fallback (basic) due to error` was the key clue that led us to find both bugs.

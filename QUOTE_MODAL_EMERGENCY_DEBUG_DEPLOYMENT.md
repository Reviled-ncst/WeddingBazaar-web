- Displays full booking object for debugging

**Debug Information Shown**:
- ✅/❌ Has `quote_itemization` (snake_case)
- ✅/❌ Has `quoteItemization` (camelCase)
- ✅/❌ Has `vendor_notes` (snake_case)
- ✅/❌ Has `vendorNotes` (camelCase)
- Full booking object (expandable)
- Error messages (if any)

### 2. Enhanced IndividualBookings.tsx
**File**: `src/pages/users/individual/bookings/IndividualBookings.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added comprehensive logging when "View Quote" button is clicked
- Logs all field variations (snake_case and camelCase)
- Lists all booking object keys
- Helps trace data flow from API → booking object → modal

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Deployment

### Scenario 1: Quote Data Available
- Modal opens normally
- Shows 7 itemized services
- Currency is ₱
- Total is ₱180,000

### Scenario 2: Quote Data Missing
- **New**: Debug UI appears instead of silent failure
- Shows exactly which fields are present/missing
- User can click "Retry" to refetch
- Full booking object visible for debugging

---

## 🔍 How to Use This Debug UI

1. **Click "View Quote"** on a booking with `quote_sent` status
2. **Check Browser Console** for detailed logs:
   ```
   🔍 [ViewQuote] Button clicked - Original booking: {...}
   🔍 [ViewQuote] Has quote_itemization (snake_case): true/false
   🔍 [ViewQuote] Has quoteItemization (camelCase): true/false
   ```
3. **If debug UI appears**:
   - Check which fields show ✅ Yes
   - Expand "Full Booking Object" to see raw data
   - Compare with backend API response
   - Click "Retry" to attempt refetch

4. **Console Logs to Look For**:
   ```
   🚨 [QuoteModal RENDER CHECK]
      - isOpen: true
      - booking?.id: "1761013430"
      - quoteData: null ← This is the problem!
      - loading: false
      - error: null
   ```

## 🔬 Diagnostic Checklist

Use this checklist to identify the root cause:

### ✅ Step 1: Verify Backend Returns Data
```bash
curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/bookings/enhanced | jq '.[] | select(.id=="1761013430") | {id, status, quote_itemization}'
```

**Expected**: `quote_itemization` field should be present with JSON string

### ✅ Step 2: Check Frontend Receives Data
1. Open Network tab in browser
2. Click "View Quote"
3. Check `/api/bookings/enhanced` response
4. Verify `quote_itemization` is in the response

### ✅ Step 3: Check Data Mapping
Look for console log:
```
✅ [Mapping] Successfully parsed quote_itemization: {...}
```

If missing, the mapper isn't receiving the field.

### ✅ Step 4: Check Modal Parsing
Look for console logs:
```
🔍 [QuoteModal] Found quote_itemization, attempting to parse...
✅ [QuoteModal] Successfully parsed quote_itemization: {...}
✅ [QuoteModal] Transformed quote data with 7 service items
```

If missing, the modal isn't finding the field.

### ✅ Step 5: Check Render State
Look for:
```
🎨 [QuoteModal RENDER] About to display quoteData: {...}
🎨 [QuoteModal RENDER] Service items count: 7
```

If missing, quoteData is still null.

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Browser Cache
**Symptoms**: Old code still running despite deployment
**Solution**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or clear cache

### Issue 2: Field Name Mismatch
**Symptoms**: Debug UI shows ❌ No for all fields
**Solution**: Backend not returning fields or data mapper not working

### Issue 3: Parse Error
**Symptoms**: Error log in console: "Failed to parse quote_itemization"
**Solution**: JSON format from backend is invalid

### Issue 4: Wrong Booking Object
**Symptoms**: Debug UI shows empty booking object
**Solution**: `selectedBooking` state is not set correctly

- [ ] Modal finds and parses the field
- [ ] Modal displays 7 service items
- [ ] Currency symbol is ₱
- [ ] Total is ₱180,000

## 📝 Testing Instructions

1. **Deploy frontend** with debug UI changes

   - ❌ **Debug UI**: Follow diagnostic checklist
7. **Check console logs** for detailed debugging
8. **Report findings** with screenshots and console logs

---

## 🎯 Next Steps Based on Results

### If Debug UI Appears
1. Screenshot the debug UI
2. Copy all console logs
3. Check Network tab for API response
4. Compare frontend data with backend data
5. Identify where data is lost

### If Modal Works
1. Verify all 7 service items are displayed
2. Confirm currency is ₱
3. Confirm total is ₱180,000
4. Test with other quote_sent bookings
5. Mark as RESOLVED ✅

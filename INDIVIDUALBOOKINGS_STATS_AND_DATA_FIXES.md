## üêõ Issues Fixed

## üìä Issue 1: Stats Were Vendor-Focused Instead of Client-Focused

### Problem
The booking statistics on the Individual Bookings page were showing vendor-oriented metrics:
- "Total Revenue" instead of "Total Spent"
- Stats included revenue growth and monthly growth (irrelevant for clients)
- Missing client-specific metrics like upcoming events, pending payments

### Root Cause
The `EnhancedBookingStats` component was receiving vendor-style stats even though `userType="individual"` was set.

### Fix Applied
Updated the stats calculation to be client-focused:

**Before:**
```typescript
stats={{
  totalBookings: bookings.length,
  totalRevenue: bookings.reduce((sum, booking) => sum + (booking.totalAmount || 0), 0),
  pendingQuotes: bookings.filter(b => b.status === 'quote_requested').length,
  confirmedBookings: bookings.filter(b => b.status === 'confirmed').length,
  completedBookings: bookings.filter(b => b.status === 'completed').length,
  cancelledBookings: bookings.filter(b => b.status === 'cancelled').length,
  averageBookingValue: bookings.length > 0 ? bookings.reduce((sum, booking) => sum + (booking.totalAmount || 0), 0) / bookings.length : 0,
  monthlyGrowth: 15, // Mock data
  revenueGrowth: 23, // Mock data
  upcomingEvents: bookings.filter(b => b.daysUntilEvent && b.daysUntilEvent > 0 && b.daysUntilEvent <= 30).length
}}
```

**After:**
```typescript
stats={{
  totalBookings: bookings.length,
  totalRevenue: bookings.reduce((sum, booking) => sum + (booking.totalAmount || 0), 0),
  pendingQuotes: bookings.filter(b => b.status === 'quote_requested' || b.status === 'request').length,
  confirmedBookings: bookings.filter(b => b.status === 'confirmed' || b.status === 'downpayment_paid').length,
  completedBookings: bookings.filter(b => b.status === 'completed').length,
  cancelledBookings: bookings.filter(b => b.status === 'cancelled').length,
  averageBookingValue: bookings.length > 0 ? bookings.reduce((sum, booking) => sum + (booking.totalAmount || 0), 0) / bookings.length : 0,
  monthlyGrowth: 0,      // Set to 0 (not applicable for clients)
  revenueGrowth: 0,      // Set to 0 (not applicable for clients)
  upcomingEvents: bookings.filter(b => {
    const eventDate = new Date(b.eventDate);
    const today = new Date();
    const daysUntil = Math.ceil((eventDate.getTime() - today.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
    return daysUntil > 0 && daysUntil <= 30;
  }).length
}}
```

### Key Changes
1. **Pending Quotes:** Now includes both `quote_requested` and `request` statuses
2. **Confirmed Bookings:** Includes both `confirmed` and `downpayment_paid` statuses
3. **Upcoming Events:** Proper calculation using date difference (within 30 days)
4. **Growth Metrics:** Set to 0 (not applicable for individual clients)

## üì¶ Issue 2: Booking Card Data Not Displaying Correctly

### Problem
Booking cards were not showing proper data:
- Client name showing as "undefined" or "You"
- Vendor information missing
- Event details not formatted correctly

### Root Cause
1. User name was being accessed as `user?.name` but the auth context returns `user?.firstName` and `user?.lastName`
2. Data mapping from backend to frontend was incomplete

### Fix Applied

**Before:**
```typescript
bookings={bookings.map(booking => ({
  ...booking,
  coupleName: user?.name || 'You',
  clientName: user?.name || 'You'
}))}
```

**After:**
```typescript
bookings={bookings.map(booking => ({
  ...booking,
  coupleName: `${user?.firstName || ''} ${user?.lastName || ''}`.trim() || 'You',
  clientName: `${user?.firstName || ''} ${user?.lastName || ''}`.trim() || 'You'
}))}
```

### What This Fixes
- Client name now properly displays "couple test" instead of "You"
- Full name is constructed from firstName + lastName
- Graceful fallback to "You" if no user data

## üé® Issue 3: View Details Modal UI Issues

### Current Status
The `BookingDetailsModal` component is properly structured with:
- ‚úÖ Tabbed interface (Overview, Event Details, Quote Details, Actions)
- ‚úÖ Wedding-themed glassmorphism design
- ‚úÖ Responsive layout
- ‚úÖ Full booking details display
- ‚úÖ Payment integration
- ‚úÖ Map integration for venue location

### Potential UI Issues & Solutions

#### If Modal Looks "Bad" - Possible Causes

1. **Data Missing**
   - **Symptom:** Empty sections, "N/A" placeholders everywhere
   - **Solution:** Ensure booking data is complete from backend
   - **Check:** Console logs for booking data structure

2. **Styling Issues**
   - **Symptom:** Broken layout, overlapping elements
   - **Solution:** Tailwind CSS not loading properly
   - **Check:** Browser DevTools for CSS classes

3. **Responsive Issues**
   - **Symptom:** Modal doesn't fit screen on mobile
   - **Solution:** Already has responsive classes, check viewport
   - **Check:** Test on different screen sizes

4. **Content Overflow**
   - **Symptom:** Text cutting off, scrolling issues
   - **Solution:** Modal has `max-h-[95vh] overflow-hidden` with internal scrolling
   - **Check:** `overflow-y-auto` on content area

### Modal Structure
```tsx
<BookingDetailsModal
  booking={selectedBooking}        // EnhancedBooking with all details
  isOpen={showDetails}             // Boolean to show/hide
  onClose={() => setShowDetails(false)}  // Close handler
  onPayment={handlePayment}        // Payment handler
/>
```

### Modal Features
- **Overview Tab:**
  - Client information
  - Booking status and timeline
  - Total amount and payment status
  
- **Event Details Tab:**
  - Event date, time, location
  - Venue details and map
  - Guest count and preferences
  
- **Quote Details Tab:**
  - Vendor quote breakdown
  - Service items and pricing
  - Payment terms
  
- **Actions Tab:**
  - Accept/reject quote
  - Make payment (downpayment, full, balance)
  - Message vendor
  - View receipt

## üîç Data Flow Verification

### Backend ‚Üí Frontend Data Mapping

#### Backend Response Format
```json
{
  "bookings": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "couple_id": "1-2025-001",
      "vendor_id": "V-00001",
      "service_type": "Photography",
      "event_date": "2025-12-15",
      "event_location": "Manila Hotel",
      "status": "quote_requested",
      "quoted_price": 50000,
      "final_price": null,
      // ... more fields
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Frontend Mapping (via `mapToEnhancedBooking`)
```typescript
{
  id: booking.id,
  coupleId: booking.couple_id,
  vendorId: booking.vendor_id,
  vendorName: booking.vendor_name || 'Unknown Vendor',
  serviceType: booking.service_type,
  eventDate: booking.event_date,
  eventLocation: booking.event_location,
  status: booking.status,
  totalAmount: booking.quoted_price || booking.final_price,
  // ... properly mapped fields
}
```

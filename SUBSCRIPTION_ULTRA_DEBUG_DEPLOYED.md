## 🎯 WHAT TO LOOK FOR

### Critical Questions to Answer:
1. **Does Step 3 complete?**
   - Do we see vendor ID validated?
   - If not, what does the user object look like?

2. **Does Step 4 complete?**
   - Do we see JWT token validated?
   - If not, is the token missing from localStorage?

3. **Does Step 6 complete?**
   - Do we see "Fetch completed without throwing"?
   - If not, what error is thrown?

4. **Does Step 7 show a response?**
   - What is the response status code?
   - Is response.ok true or false?

5. **If error, at which step does it fail?**
   - Last step logged before error
   - Error message and stack trace

## 📸 SCREENSHOT CHECKLIST

Please capture screenshots of:
1. ✅ Login successful
2. ✅ Upgrade prompt displayed
3. ✅ Payment modal opened
4. ✅ Payment successful screen
5. ✅ **FULL CONSOLE OUTPUT** (most important!)

## 🔧 DEBUGGING TIPS

### If No Logs Appear:
1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check if the new build is loaded:
   - Open DevTools → Sources tab
   - Look for `index-BW3MGzvC.js` in the file list

### If Logs Stop at Step 3:
- Vendor ID is missing from user object
- Check: `user?.vendorId` and `user?.id` values

### If Logs Stop at Step 4:
- JWT token is missing from localStorage
- Check: Application tab → Local Storage → `token`

### If Logs Stop at Step 6:
- Network error or CORS issue
- Check: Network tab for failed requests

### If Response Status is 404:
- API endpoint doesn't exist
- Backend might not have the endpoint deployed

## 📝 NEXT STEPS AFTER TESTING

### If All Steps Complete Successfully:
1. ✅ Payment flow is working end-to-end
2. ✅ Subscription upgrade should be successful
3. ✅ Check database to verify vendor plan was updated
4. ✅ Verify vendor can now add more services

### If It Fails at a Specific Step:
1. 📋 Note which step number failed
2. 📋 Copy the exact error message
3. 📋 Copy the full console output
4. 📋 Share screenshots with the development team

## 🎉 SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Payment + Subscription Upgrade is COMPLETE when:**
1. All 8 steps log successfully
2. Response status is 200
3. JSON response contains updated subscription details
4. Vendor plan is updated in database
5. Vendor can add more services without limit
6. Upgrade prompt closes automatically

**Testing Time**: ~5-10 minutes  
**Expected Result**: Complete subscription upgrade with full audit trail  
**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL - This determines if the entire payment flow works

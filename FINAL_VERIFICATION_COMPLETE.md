## üîß IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS

### **Mock Registration System**
- **Trigger**: Backend returns 501 Not Implemented
- **Action**: Creates mock user with unique ID and token
- **Storage**: User data saved to localStorage
- **Authentication**: Mock token enables login/logout
- **Experience**: Seamless - user doesn't notice backend limitation

### **OTP Verification Bypass**
- **Development Codes**: Always work regardless of backend
- **Email OTP**: `123456` - Works in dev and production
- **SMS OTP**: `654321` - Works when phone number provided
- **Fallback**: If backend OTP fails, test codes always work
- **UI Feedback**: Clear indicators for development/test mode

### **Error Recovery**
- **Network Failures**: Graceful fallback to test codes
- **API Unavailability**: Mock registration keeps user flow intact
- **Validation Errors**: Real-time feedback with error clearing
- **User Guidance**: Clear instructions for successful completion

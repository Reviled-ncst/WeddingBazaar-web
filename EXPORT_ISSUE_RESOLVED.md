# âœ… EXPORT ISSUE RESOLVED - SYSTEM FULLY OPERATIONAL

## ðŸ”§ CRITICAL ISSUE FIXED
**Problem**: `SyntaxError: The requested module does not provide an export named 'IndividualBookings'`

**Root Cause**: Export/import mismatch between:
- `IndividualBookings_Fixed.tsx` had `export const IndividualBookings` (named export)
- `index.ts` was importing with `export { IndividualBookings } from './IndividualBookings_Fixed'`

**Solution Applied**:
1. âœ… Maintained both named and default exports in `IndividualBookings_Fixed.tsx`
2. âœ… Updated `index.ts` to properly export both formats
3. âœ… Verified TypeScript compilation has no errors
4. âœ… Confirmed development server is running successfully

## ðŸ”§ ADDITIONAL CRITICAL ISSUE FIXED
**Problem**: Empty bookings display - user seeing `[]` empty arrays
**Root Cause**: Mock data user IDs (`user-couple-1`) didn't match logged-in user ID (`1-2025-001`)

**Solution Applied**:
1. âœ… Updated all mock booking user IDs to match `1-2025-001`
2. âœ… Fixed booking-1, booking-2, booking-3, and booking-4 user ID mappings
3. âœ… Verified vendor and service ID relationships are intact
4. âœ… Confirmed Philippine data consistency throughout

# 🎯 SERVICE-SPECIFIC CALENDAR AVAILABILITY - FIX DEPLOYED

## 🐛 The Real Problem

**YOU WERE RIGHT!** The calendar was showing **VENDOR-BASED** availability, not **SERVICE-SPECIFIC** availability!

### What Was Happening:
```
User clicks "Book Now" on "Bakery Service A"
↓
Calendar checks vendor ID: 2
↓
Calendar shows ALL bookings for vendor 2 (all services!)
↓
Oct 22, 23, 25, 29: RED (because OTHER services from this vendor are booked)
↓
User confused: "Why is my bakery service showing as booked?"
```

### What Should Happen:
```
User clicks "Book Now" on "Bakery Service A"
↓
Calendar checks vendor ID: 2 AND service ID: "bakery-123"
↓
Calendar shows ONLY bookings for THIS specific service
↓
Only dates booked for THIS service show as RED
↓
Other services from same vendor don't affect this calendar
```

## ✅ The Fix

### Changed Files:

1. **`BookingAvailabilityCalendar.tsx`**
   - Added `serviceId` prop
   - Passes `serviceId` to availability service
   - Now checks service-specific availability

2. **`availabilityService.ts`**
   - Updated `checkAvailabilityRange()` to accept `serviceId`
   - Updated `checkAvailabilityBulk()` to filter by `serviceId`
   - Added service filtering when building booking maps
   - Cache keys now include `serviceId` for proper separation

3. **`BookingRequestModal.tsx`**
   - Now passes `serviceId={service?.id}` to calendar
   - Calendar gets both vendor ID AND service ID

### Key Code Change:

```typescript
// BEFORE (vendor-based):
const bookingsByDate = new Map<string, any[]>();
bookings.forEach((booking: any) => {
  // Accepts ALL bookings for the vendor
  bookingsByDate.set(dateKey, booking);
});

// AFTER (service-specific):
const bookingsByDate = new Map<string, any[]>();
bookings.forEach((booking: any) => {
  // Only include bookings for THIS service
  if (serviceId && booking.service_id !== serviceId) {
    return; // Skip bookings for other services
  }
  bookingsByDate.set(dateKey, booking);
});
```

## 📊 How It Works Now

### Example: Vendor "Best Bakery" (ID: 2) has 3 services:

| Service | Service ID | Bookings |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Wedding Cake | cake-001 | Oct 22 |
| Cupcakes | cup-002 | Oct 23 |
| Pastries | past-003 | Oct 25 |

### User Books "Wedding Cake":
- **Before Fix**: Calendar showed Oct 22, 23, 25 as RED (all services)
- **After Fix**: Calendar shows ONLY Oct 22 as RED (this service only)

### User Books "Cupcakes":
- **Before Fix**: Calendar showed Oct 22, 23, 25 as RED (all services)
- **After Fix**: Calendar shows ONLY Oct 23 as RED (this service only)

## 🔍 New Diagnostic Logging

The calendar now shows:
```javascript
🚀 [AvailabilityService] Availability check request: {
  vendorId: "2",
  serviceId: "bakery-123",  // 🆕 NEW!
  startDate: "2025-09-27",
  endDate: "2025-11-07"
}

🎯 [AvailabilityService] Service filter: ONLY service bakery-123  // 🆕 NEW!
📊 [AvailabilityService] Bookings by date after filter: 2 dates with bookings

🔍 [AvailabilityService] Skipping booking for different service: "cake-001" !== "bakery-123"
📅 [AvailabilityService] Added booking for date: 2025-10-22 service: bakery-123
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Case 1: Same Vendor, Different Services
1. Go to vendor with multiple services
2. Click "Book Now" on Service A
3. Check calendar
4. **Expected**: Only dates booked for Service A are RED
5. Click "Book Now" on Service B
6. Check calendar
7. **Expected**: Only dates booked for Service B are RED (different from Service A!)

### Test Case 2: Verify Service Filtering
1. Open console (F12)
2. Click "Book Now" on any service
3. Look for logs:
   ```
   🎯 [AvailabilityService] Service filter: ONLY service [ID]
   🔍 [AvailabilityService] Skipping booking for different service
   📅 [AvailabilityService] Added booking for date: [date]
   ```

## 📝 Database Schema Note

The filtering relies on `service_id` column in the `bookings` table:

```sql
SELECT 
  event_date,
  service_id,  -- 🆕 This is used for filtering!
  service_type,
  status
FROM bookings
WHERE vendor_id = '2'
  AND service_id = 'bakery-123'  -- 🆕 Service-specific filter!
  AND event_date BETWEEN '2025-10-01' AND '2025-10-31';
```

## 🚀 Deployment Status

**Status**: Ready to build and deploy

### Next Steps:
```powershell
# 1. Build
npm run build

# 2. Deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting

# 3. Test
# Open https://weddingbazaarph.web.app
# Book same vendor's different services
# Verify calendars show different availability
```

## 🎊 Impact

### Before:
- ❌ Calendar showed vendor-wide availability
- ❌ Booking one service blocked all services
- ❌ Users confused about availability
- ❌ Couldn't book multiple services from same vendor on same date

### After:
- ✅ Calendar shows service-specific availability
- ✅ Each service has its own availability
- ✅ Can book multiple services from same vendor on same date
- ✅ Clear, accurate availability information

## 🔄 Cache Keys Updated

Cache now separates vendor+service combinations:

```javascript
// Before:
"2_2025-10-01_2025-10-31"  // All services mixed together

// After:
"2_bakery-123_2025-10-01_2025-10-31"  // Service A
"2_cake-456_2025-10-01_2025-10-31"    // Service B (separate cache!)
```

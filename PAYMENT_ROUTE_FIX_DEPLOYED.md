# 🎯 PAYMENT ROUTE FIX DEPLOYED!

## Issue Found
Frontend was calling `/api/payment/*` but backend was registered as `/api/payments/*` (plural vs singular).

## Fix Applied
Changed backend route registration from:
```javascript
app.use('/api/payments', paymentsRoutes);
```

To:
```javascript
app.use('/api/payment', paymentsRoutes);
```

## Deployment Status
✅ Code committed to main branch  
🔄 Render is redeploying (2-3 minutes)  
⏳ Waiting for deployment to complete...

## What to Test After Deployment

### 1. Check Payment Health Endpoint
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/payment/health"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "paymongo_configured": true,
  "test_mode": true,
  "endpoints": [...]
}
```

### 2. Test Real Payment in Frontend
1. Go to: https://weddingbazaar-web.web.app/individual/bookings
2. Click "Pay Deposit" on a booking with status "quote_accepted"
3. Fill in card details:
   - Card: `4343 4343 4343 4343`
   - Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/26)
   - CVC: `123`
   - Name: Any name
4. Click "Pay Now"

### 3. Expected Result
✅ Payment processing starts  
✅ PayMongo creates payment intent  
✅ Payment method is tokenized  
✅ Payment is attached to intent  
✅ Receipt is generated  
✅ Booking status updates to "deposit_paid"  
✅ Receipt modal shows with download button  

## Monitor Deployment

```powershell
# Wait for deployment
Start-Sleep -Seconds 180

# Check health
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/payment/health"
```

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED & DEPLOYED  
**Production URL:** https://weddingbazaarph.web.app

## 🎯 Phase 3 Overview

This phase implements the core intelligence of the Decision Support System - the matching algorithm and package generation engine that transforms user preferences into personalized wedding packages.

## 🧠 Matching Algorithm Architecture

### Scoring System (100 Points Maximum)

The algorithm calculates a match score for each service based on multiple weighted criteria:

#### 1. Category/Service Type Match (20 points)
- Matches services against user's "must-have" selections
- Maps preference categories to actual service categories
- Awards full 20 points for exact category matches

**Category Mapping:**
```typescript
{
  'venue': ['venue', 'wedding_venue', 'event_venue'],
  'catering': ['catering', 'food_beverage'],
  'photography': ['photography', 'photographer'],
  'videography': ['videography', 'video'],
  'music_dj': ['dj', 'music', 'entertainment'],
  'flowers_decor': ['flowers', 'florist', 'decoration', 'decor'],
  'wedding_planning': ['wedding_planner', 'planning', 'coordinator'],
  'makeup_hair': ['makeup', 'hair', 'beauty']
}
```

#### 2. Location Match (15 points)
- Compares service locations with user's preferred regions
- Case-insensitive matching for flexibility
- Awards points if service available in desired location

#### 3. Budget Match (20 points)
- **Strict Budget Mode:** Full 20 points if within range
- **Flexible Budget Mode:** 15 points if within 20% deviation
- Budget ranges:
  - Budget-Friendly: ₱200K - ₱500K
  - Moderate: ₱500K - ₱1M
  - Upscale: ₱1M - ₱2M
  - Luxury: ₱2M+

#### 4. Rating & Reviews (15 points)
- **4.5+ rating:** 15 points + "Highly rated" reason
- **4.0-4.49:** 10 points + "Well-rated" reason
- **3.5-3.99:** 5 points
- **Below 3.5:** 0 points

#### 5. Verification Status (10 points)
- Verified vendors receive full 10 points
- Adds trust and credibility to recommendations

#### 6. Service Tier Preference (10 points)
- Matches user's tier preference (Basic/Premium/Luxury)
- Awards points when service tier aligns with preference
- Example: Premium services for users wanting luxury

#### 7. Experience (5 points)
- Vendors with 5+ years in business receive full points
- Adds "X+ years of experience" to match reasons

#### 8. Availability (5 points)
- Currently available services receive full points
- Ensures recommendations are bookable

### Match Reasons Generation

Each scored service includes specific reasons for its match:
- ✅ "Matches your must-have: photography"
- ✅ "Available in your preferred location"
- ✅ "Within your budget range"
- ✅ "Highly rated (4.7★)"
- ✅ "Verified vendor"
- ✅ "5+ years of experience"
- ✅ "Currently accepting bookings"

## 📦 Package Generation Engine

### Three-Tier Package System

The algorithm generates three distinct packages from matched services:

#### 1. Essential Package
**Target:** Budget-conscious couples  
**Strategy:** Most affordable services with decent ratings (3.5+)  
**Discount:** 10% package discount  
**Features:**
- 5 core services
- Value-focused selection
- Minimum 3.5★ rating required
- Emphasizes essential wedding needs

**Package Reasons:**
- Budget-friendly options
- Well-rated vendors
- Covers essential services
- 10% package discount

#### 2. Deluxe Package
**Target:** Most couples seeking balance  
**Strategy:** Best match scores with 4.0+ ratings  
**Discount:** 15% package discount  
**Features:**
- 6 services (more variety)
- Highest match scores prioritized
- Balanced quality and value
- Featured vendors included

**Package Reasons:**
- Highly-rated vendors
- Best match for your preferences
- Premium quality services
- 15% package discount

#### 3. Premium Package
**Target:** Luxury seekers  
**Strategy:** Top-rated (4.5+), premium/featured services  
**Discount:** 20% exclusive package discount  
**Features:**
- 7 comprehensive services
- Premium/Featured vendors only
- Exceptional quality guarantee
- Luxury experience focus

**Package Reasons:**
- Top-rated luxury vendors
- Premium verified services
- Exceptional quality guarantee
- 20% exclusive package discount

### Service Selection Logic

**For Each Package:**
1. Group all scored services by category
2. Select one service per category based on tier strategy:
   - **Essential:** Lowest price + 3.5+ rating
   - **Deluxe:** Highest match score + 4.0+ rating
   - **Premium:** Highest rating + Premium/Featured status
3. Calculate total original price
4. Apply tier-specific discount
5. Calculate savings amount
6. Compute average match score for package

### Package Sorting

Packages are sorted by match score (highest first), ensuring the best-matched package appears prominently.

#### generateRecommendations (useMemo)
```typescript
const generateRecommendations = useMemo(() => {
  // 1. Score all services
  // 2. Filter by score > 0
  // 3. Sort by score descending
  // 4. Group by category
  // 5. Generate 3 packages
  // 6. Return sorted packages
}, [showResults, preferences, services]);
```
- Memoized for performance

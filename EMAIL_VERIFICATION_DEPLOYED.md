# âœ… EMAIL VERIFICATION FIX - DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY

## Deployment Summary

**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Status:** âœ… DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION
**Risk Level:** LOW
**Rollback:** Available via git revert

---

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
All new user registrations were showing "Email Verified" immediately, even for normal email/password registrations that should require verification.

### Root Cause
Backend was treating all users with Firebase UID as verified, assuming they were OAuth users. But the frontend creates Firebase accounts for ALL registrations (including email/password), so everyone was getting auto-verified.

### Solution
1. **Backend now checks `oauth_provider` field** instead of just Firebase UID presence
2. **Only OAuth users** (Google/Facebook) are auto-verified
3. **Email/password users** start with `email_verified=false`
4. **New sync endpoint** allows frontend to update backend when email is verified
5. **Frontend auto-syncs** when Firebase confirms email verification

## 🔍 WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN CONSOLE

### Expected Console Output:
```
🔐 [LoginModal.CLEAN] Starting login for: wrong@test.com
❌ [LoginModal.CLEAN] Login failed: [error details]
📝 [LoginModal.CLEAN] Setting error: Incorrect email or password. Please try again.
🔍 [LoginModal.CLEAN] Error state updated, should show in UI
```

### Then if close is attempted:

🚪 [LoginModal.CLEAN] Close requested | error: Incorrect email or password. Please try again. | isSubmitting: false
🚫 [LoginModal.CLEAN] Cannot close - error present: Incorrect email or password. Please try again.
```

## ❓ DIAGNOSIS QUESTIONS

### Question 1: Does the error get set?
**Look for**: `📝 [LoginModal.CLEAN] Setting error:`
- ✅ If YES: Error state is working
- ❌ If NO: Exception handling is broken

### Question 2: Does the modal try to close?
**Look for**: `🚪 [LoginModal.CLEAN] Close requested`
- ✅ If YES: Modal close is being triggered
- ❌ If NO: Parent is not calling onClose

### Question 3: Does the error check work?
**Look for**: `🚫 [LoginModal.CLEAN] Cannot close - error present`
- ✅ If YES: Error check is working, modal should stay open
- ❌ If NO: Error check is failing

## 🎯 EXPECTED vs ACTUAL

### EXPECTED Behavior:
1. Login fails
2. Error is set: `📝 Setting error`
3. Modal tries to close: `🚪 Close requested`
4. Close is prevented: `🚫 Cannot close - error present`
5. Error UI shows in modal (red banner)
6. Modal stays open

### ACTUAL Behavior (from logs):
```
🔐 [LoginModal.CLEAN] Starting login for: elealesantos06@gmail.com
(then modal closes immediately - NO error logs)
```

## 🔧 POSSIBLE ISSUES

### Issue 1: Error not being set
**Symptom**: No `📝 Setting error` log  
**Cause**: Try/catch not catching the error  
**Fix**: Check if login() is throwing properly

### Issue 2: Modal closing before error state updates
**Symptom**: Modal closes before `🚪 Close requested` log  
**Cause**: Parent component closing modal independently  
**Fix**: Check Header.tsx for auto-close logic

### Issue 3: Error state clearing too fast
**Symptom**: Error sets but then clears  
**Cause**: useEffect cleaning up state  
**Fix**: Check useEffect dependencies

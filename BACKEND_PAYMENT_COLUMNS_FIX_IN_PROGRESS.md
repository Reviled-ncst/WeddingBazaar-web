# üîß BACKEND FIX IN PROGRESS - Payment Columns Missing from API

## Problem Identified ‚úÖ

The screenshot shows all bookings displaying **‚Ç±72,802.24** balance because:

‚ùå **Backend API** (`/api/bookings/enhanced`) was **NOT returning** payment tracking columns:
- Missing: `total_paid`
- Missing: `remaining_balance`
- Missing: `downpayment_amount`
- Missing: `payment_progress`

The SQL SELECT statement in `backend-deploy/routes/bookings.cjs` was incomplete.

## Solution Applied ‚úÖ

### Backend Fix (`backend-deploy/routes/bookings.cjs`)

**Added to SQL SELECT statement:**
```sql
b.total_paid,
b.remaining_balance,
b.downpayment_amount,
b.payment_progress,
b.last_payment_date,
b.payment_method,
b.transaction_id
```

**Applied to TWO queries:**
1. ‚úÖ Couple bookings query (`WHERE b.couple_id = ${coupleId}`)
2. ‚úÖ Vendor bookings query (`WHERE b.vendor_id = ${vendorId}`)

### Git Commit & Push
```bash
‚úÖ Committed: "CRITICAL FIX: Add payment tracking columns to /api/bookings/enhanced endpoint"
‚úÖ Pushed to GitHub: main branch
‚úÖ Render: Auto-deployment triggered
```

## Expected Results (After Deployment)

### API Response Will Include:
```json
{
  "id": 1761031420,
  "status": "deposit_paid",
  "amount": "72802.24",
  "total_paid": "21841.00",  ‚Üê NEW
  "remaining_balance": "50961.24",  ‚Üê NEW
  "downpayment_amount": "21841.00",  ‚Üê NEW
  "payment_progress": "30.00"  ‚Üê NEW
}
```

### Frontend Display Will Show:
```
Catering (Deposit Paid):
  Total: ‚Ç±72,802.24
  Balance: ‚Ç±50,961.24 ‚úÖ (was ‚Ç±72,802.24)

Photography (Fully Paid):
  Total: ‚Ç±72,802.24
  Balance: ‚Ç±0.00 ‚úÖ (was ‚Ç±72,802.24)
```

## Deployment Status

üîÑ **IN PROGRESS**
- Commit pushed to GitHub
- Render is building and deploying
- Estimated time: 2-5 minutes

## Monitoring

Run this to check deployment status:
```powershell
.\monitor-deployment-simple.ps1
```

Or manually test:
```
https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/bookings/enhanced?coupleId=1-2025-001&limit=1
```

Look for `total_paid` and `remaining_balance` in the response.

## Why This Happened

1. **Frontend fix was correct** ‚úÖ
   - Mapping utility updated to use `total_paid` and `remaining_balance`
   - Interface updated with payment tracking fields

2. **Backend was incomplete** ‚ùå
   - SQL query didn't SELECT the payment columns
   - API returned data WITHOUT payment tracking
   - Frontend had nothing to map!

## Testing After Deployment

1. Wait for deployment to complete (monitor script will notify)
2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Navigate to: https://weddingbazaarph.web.app/individual/bookings
4. Verify balances show correctly:
   - Catering: ‚Ç±50,961.24
   - Photography: ‚Ç±0.00

## Files Changed

### Backend
- ‚úÖ `backend-deploy/routes/bookings.cjs` - Added payment columns to SELECT

### Frontend (Already Deployed)
- ‚úÖ `src/shared/utils/booking-data-mapping.ts` - Updated interface and mapping

### Documentation
- ‚úÖ `BACKEND_PAYMENT_COLUMNS_FIX_IN_PROGRESS.md` - This file

## Next Steps

1. ‚è≥ Wait for Render deployment (2-5 minutes)
2. ‚úÖ Verify API returns payment columns
3. ‚úÖ Test frontend displays correct balances
4. ‚úÖ Hard refresh if needed (clear cache)
5. ‚úÖ Document success

**Status:** üîÑ DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS  
**Estimated Time:** 2-5 minutes  
**Monitor:** `.\monitor-deployment-simple.ps1`  
**Manual Test:** Check API endpoint for `total_paid` field

## üîç What Was Fixed

### The Problem
Services were showing "Price on request" even when pricing was entered because:
1. Form wasn't clearing incompatible fields when switching between pricing modes
2. Both pricing types were being sent to backend regardless of active mode
3. This caused empty or conflicting pricing data

### The Solution
1. **Clear fields on toggle**: When switching modes, clear the inactive mode's fields
2. **Send only active mode data**: Only send `price_range` OR `price`/`max_price`, never both
3. **Enforce mutual exclusivity**: Ensure only one pricing method is used at a time

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Create Service with Recommended Range
1. Go to: https://weddingbazaarph.web.app
2. Login as vendor
3. Navigate to "My Services" page
4. Click "Add New Service" button
5. Fill in basic info (Step 1)
6. **Step 2 - Pricing**:
   - Keep "Recommended Price Range" active (default)
   - Select a price range (e.g., "‚Ç±30,000 - ‚Ç±50,000")
   - Click Next through all steps
   - Submit the service
7. **Expected Result**: Service card displays "‚Ç±30,000 - ‚Ç±50,000" ‚úÖ

### Test 2: Create Service with Custom Pricing
1. Add another new service
2. Fill in basic info (Step 1)
3. **Step 2 - Pricing**:
   - Click "Set Custom Pricing" button
   - Enter Minimum Price: 45000
   - Enter Maximum Price: 75000
   - Click Next through all steps
   - Submit the service
4. **Expected Result**: Service card displays "‚Ç±45,000 - ‚Ç±75,000" ‚úÖ

### Test 3: Toggle Between Modes
1. Add another new service
2. Fill in basic info (Step 1)
3. **Step 2 - Pricing**:
   - Select "‚Ç±10,000 - ‚Ç±30,000" (recommended)
   - Click "Set Custom Pricing"
   - ‚úÖ Verify: Price range selection is cleared
   - Enter custom prices: 25000 - 35000
   - Click "Use Recommended Range"

   - ‚úÖ Verify: "‚Ç±10,000 - ‚Ç±25,000" is pre-selected
4. **Expected Result**: Fields clear correctly when toggling ‚úÖ

### Test 4: Validation Check
1. Add another new service
2. Fill in basic info (Step 1)
3. **Step 2 - Pricing**:
   - Keep "Recommended Price Range" active
   - DON'T select any range
   - Try to click "Next Step"
4. **Expected Result**: 
   - ‚ùå Validation error: "Please select a price range"
   - Cannot proceed to next step ‚úÖ

### Test 5: Edit Existing Service
1. Find a service showing "Price on request"
2. Click "Edit Details"
3. Navigate to Step 2 - Pricing
4. Select a price range or enter custom pricing
5. Save changes
6. **Expected Result**: Service now displays correct pricing ‚úÖ

## üìä Verification Checklist

After testing, verify:

- [ ] New services with recommended range display correct price range
- [ ] New services with custom pricing display "‚Ç±X - ‚Ç±Y" format
- [ ] Toggling between modes clears fields correctly
- [ ] Validation prevents submission without pricing
- [ ] Confirmation modal shows correct pricing before submission
- [ ] Backend receives only active mode's pricing data
- [ ] Service cards display pricing immediately after creation

## üêõ Known Issues (Optional Fixes)

### Issue: Old Services Still Show "Price on Request"
**Cause**: Created before the fix with no pricing data
**Solution**: Vendors need to edit these services and add pricing
**Status**: Not a bug, expected behavior

### Issue: Some Services Have Both price_range AND price
**Cause**: Created with old buggy code
**Solution**: Backend should prioritize `price_range` if both exist
**Status**: Consider adding backend logic to handle this edge case

## üîß Backend Priority Logic (Optional Enhancement)

Consider adding this logic in the backend service display:
```javascript
// Display pricing with priority
const displayPrice = service.price_range 
  ? service.price_range 
  : service.price && service.max_price 
    ? `‚Ç±${service.price.toLocaleString()} - ‚Ç±${service.max_price.toLocaleString()}`
    : service.price 
      ? `Starting at ‚Ç±${service.price.toLocaleString()}`
      : 'Price on request';
```

## üìû Support

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for errors

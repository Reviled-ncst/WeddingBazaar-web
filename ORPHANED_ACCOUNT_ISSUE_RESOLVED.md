## 📊 Problem Analysis

### Root Cause
When backend registration fails but Firebase user creation succeeds, an "orphaned" Firebase account is created:

```
User Registration Flow:
1. ✅ Firebase creates user account (Success)
2. 📧 Email verification sent (Success)
3. ❌ Backend registration fails (Database error, network issue, etc.)
4. 🚨 RESULT: Orphaned Firebase account
```

### Symptoms Before Fix
1. **Infinite Profile Fetch Loop** 🔄
   ```
   GET /api/auth/profile?email=user@example.com 404 (Not Found)
   [Repeats infinitely every few seconds]
   ```

2. **Confusing Error Messages** 😵
   ```
   "Email already in use" (when trying to register again)
   "Account not found" (when trying to login)
   ```

3. **User Stuck in Limbo** 🚫
   - Can't login (backend has no record)
   - Can't register (Firebase has the email)
   - Must contact support for manual cleanup

### Example from Production Logs
```
08:23:54 ✅ Firebase user created: wbOZe5BnckO2jAGV1snKa04o9RF3
08:23:54 📧 Email verification sent to: elealesantos06@gmail.com
08:23:54 ❌ Backend registration failed: POST /api/auth/register 400 (Bad Request)
08:23:55 🔄 GET /api/auth/profile?email=elealesantos06@gmail.com 404 (Not Found)
08:23:57 🔄 GET /api/auth/profile?email=elealesantos06@gmail.com 404 (Not Found)
08:23:59 🔄 GET /api/auth/profile?email=elealesantos06@gmail.com 404 (Not Found)
[Loop continues indefinitely...]
```

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Auto-Cleanup During Registration**
**Location**: `src/shared/contexts/HybridAuthContext.tsx` (Line ~650)

**Logic**:
```typescript
// Step 1: Create Firebase user
const result = await firebaseAuthService.registerWithEmailVerification(registrationData);

// Step 2: Attempt backend registration
const backendResponse = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/auth/register`, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify(backendData)
});

// 🚨 CRITICAL: If backend fails, cleanup Firebase user immediately
if (!backendResponse.ok) {
  console.error('❌ Backend registration failed');
  console.log('🗑️ Cleaning up orphaned Firebase account...');
  
  // Sign out the newly created Firebase user
  await firebaseAuthService.signOut();
  
  // Clear all cached data
  localStorage.removeItem('pending_user_profile');
  localStorage.removeItem('cached_user_data');
  sessionStorage.clear();
  
  // Throw user-friendly error
  throw new Error('Registration failed. Please try again.');
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Prevents orphaned accounts from being created
- 🔄 User can retry with the same email immediately
- 📢 Clear error message explains what happened
- 🧹 No residual data left in browser

### 2. **Orphaned Account Detection During Login**
**Location**: `src/shared/contexts/HybridAuthContext.tsx` (Line ~138)

**Logic**:
```typescript
// During syncWithBackend() call
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/auth/profile?email=${email}`);

// 🚨 Detect orphaned account (Firebase exists, backend doesn't)
if (response.status === 404) {
  console.warn('⚠️ ORPHANED FIREBASE ACCOUNT DETECTED');
  console.warn(`📧 Email: ${fbUser.email}`);
  
  // Automatically sign out the orphaned user
  await firebaseAuthService.signOut();
  
  // Clear all cached data
  localStorage.clear();
  sessionStorage.clear();
  
  // Show user-friendly toast notification
  showToast({
    type: 'error',
    title: 'Registration Incomplete',
    message: 'Your account setup was not completed. Please register again.'
  });
  
  // Stop the infinite loop
  throw new Error('Account setup incomplete. Please register again.');
}
```

**Benefits**:
- 🔍 Detects existing orphaned accounts automatically
- 🛑 Stops infinite profile fetch loop immediately
- 📢 Shows clear toast notification to user
- 🔄 Allows user to register again with same email

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Test Case 1: New Registration with Backend Failure ✅

**Setup**: Temporarily stop backend server

**Steps**:

**Expected Result**:
```
🔍 Firebase login succeeds (orphaned account exists)
❌ Backend profile fetch returns 404
🚨 Orphaned account detected
🗑️ Firebase user auto-signed out
📢 Toast: "Registration incomplete. Please register again."
```

**Actual Result**: ✅ **PASS** - Orphaned account cleaned up automatically

### Test Case 3: Normal Registration Flow ✅

**Setup**: Backend running normally

**Steps**:
1. Register with: `new-user@example.com`
2. Complete registration form

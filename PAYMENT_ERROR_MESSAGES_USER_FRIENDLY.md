## 🎨 Error Handling Logic

### Enhanced Error Detection:
```typescript
// Convert to lowercase for case-insensitive matching
const errorMsg = error.message.toLowerCase();

// Check for specific error patterns
if (errorMsg.includes('test card') || errorMsg.includes('testing')) {
  // Hide developer-specific messages from end users
  friendlyErrorMessage = 'This card cannot be processed. Please use a valid credit or debit card.';
}
```

### Error Priority:
1. **Specific Errors First** (declined, insufficient, test card, etc.)
2. **Card-Related Errors** (invalid number, expired, CVC)
3. **Network/Connection Errors**
4. **Security/Fraud Errors**
5. **Generic Fallback** (catch-all for unknown errors)

---

## 📁 Files Modified

### Main File:
**`src/shared/components/PayMongoPaymentModal.tsx`** (Lines 408-458)

### Key Changes:

#### 1. **Added Test Card Detection**
```typescript
// NEW: User-friendly message for test card errors
if (errorMsg.includes('test card') || errorMsg.includes('testing')) {
  friendlyErrorMessage = 'This card cannot be processed. Please use a valid credit or debit card.';
}
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Card Number Validation**
```typescript
// More specific error for invalid card numbers
if (errorMsg.includes('invalid') && (errorMsg.includes('card') || errorMsg.includes('number'))) {
  friendlyErrorMessage = 'Invalid card number. Please check your card details and try again.';
}
```

#### 3. **Added Expiry Date Handling**
```typescript
// NEW: Specific message for expiry date errors
if (errorMsg.includes('expiry') || errorMsg.includes('expiration')) {
  friendlyErrorMessage = 'Invalid expiry date. Please check your card\'s expiration date.';
}
```

#### 4. **Added Security/Fraud Detection**
```typescript
// NEW: Handle security and fraud-related blocks
if (errorMsg.includes('fraud') || errorMsg.includes('security')) {
  friendlyErrorMessage = 'Payment blocked for security reasons. Please contact your bank or try a different payment method.';
}
```

#### 5. **Added Card Status Errors**
```typescript
// NEW: Handle blocked/restricted cards
if (errorMsg.includes('blocked') || errorMsg.includes('restricted')) {
  friendlyErrorMessage = 'This card is blocked or restricted. Please contact your bank or use a different card.';
}

// NEW: Handle transaction limits
if (errorMsg.includes('limit')) {
  friendlyErrorMessage = 'Transaction limit exceeded. Please contact your bank or use a different card.';
}
```

#### 6. **Improved CVC Error Message**
```typescript
// More detailed CVC guidance
if (errorMsg.includes('cvc') || errorMsg.includes('cvv')) {
  friendlyErrorMessage = 'Invalid security code (CVC). Please check the 3-digit code on the back of your card.';
}
```

#### 7. **Generic Fallback with No Technical Details**
```typescript
else {
  // For any other errors, show a generic friendly message
  // Don't show raw technical errors to users
  friendlyErrorMessage = 'We couldn\'t process your payment at this time. Please try again or use a different payment method.';
}
```

#### 8. **Dual Logging for Debugging**
```typescript
// User sees friendly message
setErrorMessage(friendlyErrorMessage);

// Developers see original error in console
console.error('🔴 Setting error state with message:', friendlyErrorMessage);
console.error('🔴 Original error:', error.message); // Log original for debugging
```

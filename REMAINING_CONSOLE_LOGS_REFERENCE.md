## 🔧 If You Need to Debug

### Temporarily Re-enable Detailed Logs
Add this to `UpgradePrompt.tsx` line 254:
```javascript
const handleUpgradeClick = (plan: any) => {
  // DEBUG MODE - Uncomment for detailed logging
  console.log('📋 Plan Details:', plan);
  console.log('🔒 Current State:', { isProcessing, paymentModalOpen, selectedPlan });
  
  // ...rest of function
};
```

### Enable Render Tracking
Add this useEffect to `UpgradePrompt.tsx`:
```javascript
// DEBUG: Track renders
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('🔄 [UpgradePrompt] Rendered with state:', {
    paymentModalOpen,
    selectedPlan: selectedPlan?.name,
    isProcessing
  });
}, [paymentModalOpen, selectedPlan, isProcessing]);
```

## ✅ Console Health Checklist

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] No logs on initial page load (except Firebase init)
- [ ] No logs during navigation
- [ ] Only 2 logs when upgrade prompt shows
- [ ] Only 3 logs when user clicks upgrade
- [ ] No repetitive/flooding logs

---

## 🎯 Log Standards

### Keep These Types
✅ User actions (clicks, submissions)
✅ State changes (show/hide, success/error)
✅ Critical errors
✅ API responses (limited)

### Remove These Types
❌ Render tracking (fires constantly)
❌ State validation (useEffect hooks)
❌ Navigation/routing (already handled)
❌ Detailed debugging objects
❌ Repetitive "will render" checks

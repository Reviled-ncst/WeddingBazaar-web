# BOOKING CREATION 400 ERROR - FIXED! ‚úÖ

## Summary
The BookingRequestModal was showing "‚ùå Something went wrong" with a 400 error, but the actual API calls were succeeding. The issue was in the frontend's error handling and promise chain management.

## Root Cause
The error was caused by complex promise chain handling with `AbortSignal.timeout()` and nested promise tracking that was throwing "Uncaught (in promise)" errors even when the API responded successfully.

## What Was Fixed
1. **Simplified Promise Handling**: Removed complex promise chaining and timeout racing
2. **Cleaner Error Handling**: Used direct async/await instead of promise chains
3. **Better Error Logging**: Added more detailed logging to identify response vs processing errors
4. **Removed AbortSignal.timeout()**: This was causing promise rejection issues in some browsers

## Changes Made
- **File**: `src/modules/services/components/BookingRequestModal.tsx`
- **Lines**: ~700-750 (error handling section)
- **Change**: Simplified from complex promise chains to straightforward async/await
- **Result**: Clean, reliable booking creation without false error messages

## Verification Results ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **API Endpoint**: `/api/bookings/request` working correctly
- ‚úÖ **Backend Response**: 200 OK with valid booking data
- ‚úÖ **Booking Creation**: Successfully creates bookings in database
- ‚úÖ **IndividualBookings**: New bookings appear immediately in user's booking list
- ‚úÖ **Frontend Error**: No more false 400 errors or "Something went wrong" messages

## Test Results
```javascript
// Test booking created successfully:
{
  "bookingId": 1760459106,

  "coupleId": "1-2025-001",
  "eventDate": "2025-10-18",
  "status": "request"
}
```

## Status: DEPLOYED ‚úÖ
- **Build**: Successful
- **Deploy**: Firebase Hosting updated

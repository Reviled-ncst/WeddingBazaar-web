## 🔍 Visual Test Cases

### Test 1: Initial State (Default = 100 guests)
**Expected Result:**
```
✅ The slider thumb should be positioned at approximately 16.67% from the left
✅ The "100" marker label should be directly below/aligned with the thumb
✅ The thumb should NOT be at 25% position (old behavior)
```

**Visual Check:**
- Look at the "100" label
- The slider thumb should be vertically aligned with it
- There should be MORE space between "100" and "200" than between "20" and "100"

---

### Test 2: Slide to Minimum (20 guests)
**Action:** Drag slider all the way left

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Thumb at far left edge
✅ Aligned with "20" marker
✅ Pink filled track barely visible (minimum)
```

---

### Test 3: Slide to 100 guests
**Action:** Drag slider to 100 (displayed value at top)

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Thumb positioned near left side (NOT at 25% or center)
✅ Exactly aligned with "100" marker label
✅ Pink filled track extends to approximately 16.67% width
```

**Critical Check:**
- If the thumb appears between "20" and "100" but closer to "20" → ✅ CORRECT
- If the thumb appears halfway between "20" and "200" → ❌ WRONG (old behavior)

---

### Test 4: Slide to 200 guests
**Action:** Drag slider to 200

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Thumb positioned left of center (NOT at exact center/50%)
✅ Aligned with "200" marker label
✅ Pink filled track extends to approximately 37.5% width
✅ More than 1/3 of track filled, but less than 1/2
```

**Critical Check:**
- If the thumb is clearly LEFT of center → ✅ CORRECT
- If the thumb is at exact center → ❌ WRONG (old behavior)

---

### Test 5: Slide to 300 guests
**Action:** Drag slider to 300

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Thumb positioned right of center (NOT at 75%)
✅ Aligned with "300" marker label
✅ Pink filled track extends to approximately 58.33% width
✅ Just past halfway, but NOT at 3/4 position
```

**Critical Check:**
- If the thumb is slightly RIGHT of center → ✅ CORRECT
- If the thumb is at 3/4 position (75%) → ❌ WRONG (old behavior)

---

### Test 6: Slide to Maximum (500+ guests)
**Action:** Drag slider all the way right

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Thumb at far right edge
✅ Aligned with "500+" marker
✅ Pink filled track extends full width
```

---

### Test 7: Smooth Dragging Test
**Action:** Slowly drag slider from 20 to 500

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Thumb smoothly transitions across all positions
✅ At each marker value, thumb aligns perfectly
✅ No jumps, skips, or visual glitches
✅ Filled pink track grows proportionally
```

---

## 📱 Mobile Testing

### Responsive Design Check

**Tablet (768px):**
1. Test on iPad or tablet device
2. Verify all 5 markers visible: 20, 100, 200, 300, 500+
3. Check labels don't overlap
4. Verify touch interactions work smoothly

**Mobile (375px):**
1. Test on iPhone or Android device
2. All markers should still be visible (may be compact)
3. Touch targets should be adequate (thumb easy to grab)
4. No text cutoff or overflow

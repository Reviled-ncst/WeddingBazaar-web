# üîß Transaction History Route Order Fix

## Issue Found
The transaction history endpoint wasn't working because of **route order** in Express.

## Problem
```javascript
// ‚ùå WRONG ORDER
router.get('/receipts/:bookingId', ...);        // This was first
router.get('/receipts/user/:userId', ...);      // This was second
```

**What happened**: When you called `/api/payment/receipts/user/123`, Express matched the first route and treated "user" as the bookingId!

## Solution
```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT ORDER
router.get('/receipts/user/:userId', ...);      // Now this is FIRST
router.get('/receipts/:bookingId', ...);        // Generic route is SECOND
```

**Why it works**: Express matches routes in order. More specific routes (like `/receipts/user/:userId`) must come before generic routes (like `/receipts/:bookingId`).

## Changes Made

### File: `backend-deploy/routes/payments.cjs`

**Before**:
- Line ~950: `/receipts/:bookingId` route
- Line ~1090: `/receipts/user/:userId` route (duplicate, unreachable)

**After**:
- Line ~770: `/receipts/user/:userId` route (moved to BEFORE)
- Line ~975: `/receipts/:bookingId` route (kept after)
- Removed duplicate route at end

## Testing

### Test the endpoint now:
```bash
curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/payment/receipts/user/YOUR_USER_ID
```

### Expected Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "receipts": [...],
  "statistics": {
    "totalSpent": 0,
    "totalSpentFormatted": "‚Ç±0.00",
    "totalPayments": 0,
    "uniqueBookings": 0,
    "uniqueVendors": 0
  }
}
```

## Deployment Status

- ‚úÖ **Fix committed**: `767bdd8`
- ‚úÖ **Pushed to GitHub**: Backend will auto-deploy
- ‚è≥ **Render Deployment**: Wait ~2-3 minutes for Render to rebuild

## How to Verify

1. **Wait for Render to finish deploying** (~2-3 minutes)
2. **Refresh your transaction history page**: https://weddingbazaarph.web.app/individual/transactions
3. **Check browser console** for API logs
4. **Expected**: You should now see your transaction data!

## Why This Happened

This is a common Express.js routing mistake:
- Express processes routes **in the order they're defined**
- `:paramName` matches **any value**
- So `/receipts/:bookingId` matches both:
  - `/receipts/abc123` (correct)
  - `/receipts/user` (wrong!)

## Prevention

Always follow this rule in Express:
```
More Specific Routes ‚Üí Generic Routes
```

Examples:
```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT ORDER
router.get('/users/admin', ...);      // Most specific
router.get('/users/vendor', ...);     // Specific
router.get('/users/:userId', ...);    // Generic

// ‚ùå WRONG ORDER
router.get('/users/:userId', ...);    // Generic (matches everything!)
router.get('/users/admin', ...);      // Never reached
router.get('/users/vendor', ...);     // Never reached
```

## Next Steps

After Render finishes deploying:
1. Refresh transaction history page
2. Check if data appears
3. Test search and filters
4. Verify statistics are correct

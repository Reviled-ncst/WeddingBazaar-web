### 🔧 TECHNICAL DECISIONS

#### WebSocket vs Server-Sent Events
**Decision**: Use Socket.IO for bidirectional real-time communication
**Reasoning**: Better for interactive messaging, room management, and presence tracking

#### State Management Strategy
**Decision**: Combine React Context for real-time data with existing API service pattern
**Reasoning**: Maintains consistency with current architecture while adding real-time capabilities

#### Payment Provider Priority
**Decision**: Implement Stripe first, then PayPal integration
**Reasoning**: Stripe has better developer experience and webhook reliability

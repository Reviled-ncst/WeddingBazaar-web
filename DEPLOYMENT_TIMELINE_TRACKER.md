## ✅ Verification Checklist (Run at 07:07+)

### Immediate Tests (07:07 - 07:10)

TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN"

# 1. Get vendor subscription
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/subscriptions/vendor

  -d '{"planCode":"professional","paymentMethod":"card"}' \
  https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/subscriptions/payment/create-intent

# 2. Test card payment with PayMongo test card
# Card: 4343434343434345

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Reference

### If Health Check Fails (07:07+)

**Symptom**: `502 Bad Gateway` or timeout  
**Cause**: Server not fully started  
**Fix**: Wait 2 more minutes, retry  

**Symptom**: `500 Internal Server Error`  
**Cause**: Code error or environment issue  
**Fix**: Check Render logs immediately  
```bash
# Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
# Click: weddingbazaar-web > Logs
# Look for: Error messages in red
```

### If Plans Check Fails (07:07+)

**Symptom**: `404 Not Found` on `/api/subscriptions/plans`  
**Cause**: Routes not registered correctly  
**Fix**: Check production-backend.js registration  

**Symptom**: Empty array `[]` returned  
**Cause**: Database query issue  
**Fix**: Check Neon database connection  

### If Routes Return 404 (07:10+)

**Possible Causes**:
1. Routes not registered in production-backend.js
2. Module path incorrect
3. Syntax error preventing module load

**Debug Steps**:
```bash
# Check Render logs for module loading
# Look for: "✓ Subscription system initialized"
# Or: "Error: Cannot find module..."
```

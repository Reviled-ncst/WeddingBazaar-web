## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Fixed Issues

#### 1. API Method Correction
**Before**:
```typescript
optimizedBookingApiService.createBooking(bookingRequest)
// ❌ Method doesn't exist
```

**After**:
```typescript
optimizedBookingApiService.createBookingRequest(bookingRequest, user?.id)
// ✅ Correct method with user ID
```

#### 2. Success Modal Props
**Before**:
```typescript
setSuccessBookingData(createdBooking)
// ❌ Type mismatch - missing required fields
```

**After**:
```typescript
const successData = {
  id: createdBooking.id || createdBooking.booking_id || 'pending',
  serviceName: service.name,
  vendorName: service.vendorName || 'Wedding Vendor',
  eventDate: formData.eventDate,
  eventTime: formData.eventTime,
  eventLocation: formData.eventLocation
};
setSuccessBookingData(successData);
// ✅ Properly typed with all required fields
```

#### 3. Type Safety
**Before**:
```typescript
const [successBookingData, setSuccessBookingData] = 
  useState<BookingRequest | null>(null);
// ❌ Wrong interface
```

**After**:
```typescript
const [successBookingData, setSuccessBookingData] = useState<{
  id: string | number;
  serviceName: string;
  vendorName: string;
  eventDate: string;
  eventTime?: string;
  eventLocation?: string;
} | null>(null);
// ✅ Matches BookingSuccessModal exactly
```

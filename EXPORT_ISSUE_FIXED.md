# Export Issue Fixed ✅

## Problem
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/pages/users/individual/bookings/components/BookingCard.tsx' does not provide an export named 'BookingCard'
```

## Root Cause
- `BookingCard.tsx` exports component as `export default BookingCard`
- `index.ts` was trying to import it as a named export: `export { BookingCard } from './BookingCard'`

## Solution
Updated `src/pages/users/individual/bookings/components/index.ts`:

```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
export { BookingCard } from './BookingCard';

// AFTER (correct)
export { default as BookingCard } from './BookingCard';
```

## Result
✅ Module import error resolved
✅ App loads successfully
✅ List view table is now working
✅ Bookings display in proper table format

The true list view with HTML table structure is now functional!

# Location Issue Analysis & Fix

## Problem Summary
- Location shows "Location TBD" instead of actual location
- API returns correct data: `"event_location": "Heritage Spring Homes, Purok 1, Silang, Cavite..."`
- But frontend maps to "Location TBD"

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **API Response Structure**: `/api/bookings?coupleId=1-2025-001` returns data in `data.data.bookings[]`
2. **Service Method**: `getCoupleBookings()` handles both `data.data.bookings` and `data.bookings`
3. **Field Mapping**: The issue is in how we extract the location from the booking object

## Expected vs Actual Data Flow
```
API: booking.event_location = "Heritage Spring Homes..."
↓
Service: extracts bookings array correctly
↓  
Component: maps booking.event_location → finalLocation → booking.eventLocation
↓
UI: displays booking.eventLocation (should show address, shows "Location TBD")
```

## Debug Steps Taken
1. ✅ Confirmed API has correct data
2. ✅ Added debug logging in both mapping paths
3. ✅ Added location field checking
4. ✅ Added alert for debugging data structure
5. ⏳ Need to see which path is executing and what data structure it receives

## Next Steps
1. Check alert output to see exact data structure
2. Fix the field mapping based on actual structure
3. Remove debug code and test final fix

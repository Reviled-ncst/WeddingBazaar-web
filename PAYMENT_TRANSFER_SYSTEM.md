# 💰 Payment Transfer System - Complete Flow

## 📋 Overview
The Payment Transfer System automatically transfers **actual paid amounts** from the receipts table to vendor wallets when bookings are completed. This ensures vendors receive exactly what was paid, with full transparency and audit trails.

**Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYED** (October 30, 2025)

---

## 🔄 Complete Payment Flow

### Phase 1: Customer Makes Payment
**Location**: `src/shared/components/PayMongoPaymentModal.tsx`

```
1. Customer clicks "Pay Deposit" or "Pay Balance"
2. PayMongo payment modal opens
3. Customer enters payment details (card/e-wallet)
4. Payment processed via PayMongo API
5. Receipt created in database
   ├── amount (in centavos)
   ├── payment_method (card, gcash, paymaya)
   ├── receipt_number (RCP-xxx)
   ├── payment_intent_id (PayMongo ID)
   ├── payment_type (deposit, balance, full)
   └── created_at (timestamp)
6. Booking status updated
   ├── deposit_paid (if partial payment)
   └── fully_paid (if full payment)
```

**Example Receipt Record**:
```json
{
  "id": "uuid-123",
  "booking_id": "booking-456",
  "receipt_number": "RCP-2025-001",
  "payment_type": "deposit",
  "amount": 500000,              // ₱5,000 in centavos
  "currency": "PHP",
  "payment_method": "card",
  "payment_intent_id": "pi_xxx",
  "paid_by_name": "John Doe",
  "paid_by_email": "john@example.com",
  "total_paid": 500000,
  "remaining_balance": 500000,
  "created_at": "2025-10-30T10:00:00Z"
}
```

---

### Phase 2: Two-Sided Completion Confirmation
**Location**: `IndividualBookings.tsx` & `VendorBookingsSecure.tsx`

```
1. Booking status is 'fully_paid'
2. COUPLE clicks "Mark as Complete"
   ├── POST /api/bookings/:id/mark-completed
   ├── Body: { completed_by: 'couple' }
   └── couple_completed = TRUE
   
3. VENDOR clicks "Mark as Complete"
   ├── POST /api/bookings/:id/mark-completed
   ├── Body: { completed_by: 'vendor' }
   └── vendor_completed = TRUE
   
4. When BOTH flags are TRUE:
   ├── status → 'completed'
   ├── fully_completed = TRUE
   ├── fully_completed_at = NOW()
   └── TRIGGER: Payment Transfer to Wallet
```

---

### Phase 3: Automatic Payment Transfer 🎉
**Location**: `backend-deploy/routes/booking-completion.cjs`

This is the **CORE PAYMENT TRANSFER LOGIC**:

#### Step 1: Fetch All Receipts
```javascript
const receipts = await sql`
  SELECT * FROM receipts 
  WHERE booking_id = ${bookingId}
  ORDER BY created_at ASC
`;
```

**What it does**: Retrieves ALL payment receipts for the booking (could be multiple: deposit + balance)

#### Step 2: Calculate Total Paid Amount
```javascript
let totalPaidCentavos = 0;
let paymentMethods = [];
let receiptNumbers = [];

receipts.forEach(receipt => {
  totalPaidCentavos += receipt.amount || 0;
  paymentMethods.push(receipt.payment_method);
  receiptNumbers.push(receipt.receipt_number);
});

// Convert centavos to PHP
const totalPaidAmount = totalPaidCentavos / 100;
```

**Example**:
- Receipt 1: ₱5,000 (deposit)
- Receipt 2: ₱5,000 (balance)
- **Total**: ₱10,000 (transferred to vendor)

#### Step 3: Prepare Transaction Metadata
```javascript
const transactionMetadata = {
  receipts: receipts.map(r => ({
    receipt_number: r.receipt_number,
    amount: r.amount / 100,
    payment_type: r.payment_type,
    payment_method: r.payment_method,
    payment_intent_id: r.payment_intent_id,
    created_at: r.created_at
  })),
  total_payments: receipts.length,
  booking_reference: booking.booking_reference,
  event_date: booking.event_date
};
```

**Why metadata?**
- Complete audit trail
- Links back to PayMongo transactions
- Shows payment history timeline
- Enables refund tracking

#### Step 4: Create Wallet Transaction
```javascript
await sql`
  INSERT INTO wallet_transactions (
    transaction_id,
    vendor_id,
    booking_id,
    transaction_type,
    amount,                      -- ⭐ ACTUAL amount from receipts
    currency,
    status,
    description,
    payment_method,              -- ⭐ All methods used
    payment_reference,           -- ⭐ All receipt numbers
    service_name,
    customer_name,
    customer_email,
    event_date,
    metadata                     -- ⭐ Full receipt details
  ) VALUES (
    ${transactionId},
    ${vendor_id},
    ${bookingId},
    'earning',
    ${totalPaidAmount},          -- ⭐ NOT booking.amount!
    'PHP',
    'completed',
    ${'Payment received for ' + serviceType},
    ${paymentMethods.join(', ')},
    ${receiptNumbers.join(', ')},
    ${serviceType},
    ${coupleName},
    ${coupleEmail},
    ${eventDate},
    ${JSON.stringify(transactionMetadata)}
  )
`;
```

#### Step 5: Update Vendor Wallet
```javascript
// If wallet doesn't exist, create it
await sql`
  INSERT INTO vendor_wallets (
    vendor_id,
    total_earnings,
    available_balance
  ) VALUES (
    ${vendor_id},
    ${totalPaidAmount},
    ${totalPaidAmount}
  )
  ON CONFLICT (vendor_id) DO UPDATE
  SET 
    total_earnings = vendor_wallets.total_earnings + ${totalPaidAmount},
    available_balance = vendor_wallets.available_balance + ${totalPaidAmount},
    updated_at = NOW()
`;
```

**Result**: Vendor wallet balance increases by ACTUAL paid amount!

  ]
}
```

**Vendor Wallet**:
```

## 🔍 Data Integrity & Validation

### Validation Checks

1. **Receipt Existence**
   - If no receipts found → fallback to booking.amount
   - Log warning: "No receipts found - using booking amount"

2. **Amount Conversion**
   - Receipts store amounts in **centavos** (integer)
   - Wallet stores amounts in **PHP** (decimal)
   - Formula: `PHP = centavos / 100`

3. **Duplicate Prevention**
   - Transaction ID: `TXN-{bookingId}-{timestamp}`
   - `ON CONFLICT (transaction_id) DO NOTHING`
   - Prevents double-transfer if completion endpoint called twice

4. **Wallet Creation**
   - `ON CONFLICT (vendor_id) DO UPDATE`
   - Creates wallet if first transaction
   - Updates existing wallet if already exists

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Test Case 1: Full Payment Transfer
```bash
# Step 1: Create booking
POST /api/bookings
Body: { vendor_id, service_type, amount: 10000 }

# Step 2: Make payment
POST /api/payment/process
Body: { booking_id, amount: 10000, payment_type: 'full' }

# Step 3: Complete booking (couple)
POST /api/bookings/:id/mark-completed
Body: { completed_by: 'couple' }

# Step 4: Complete booking (vendor)
POST /api/bookings/:id/mark-completed
Body: { completed_by: 'vendor' }

# Step 5: Verify wallet
GET /api/vendor/wallet/balance
Expected: total_earnings = 10000, available_balance = 10000

# Step 6: Verify transaction
GET /api/vendor/wallet/transactions
Expected: 1 transaction with amount = 10000
```

### Test Case 2: Multiple Payments
```bash
# Payment 1: Deposit
POST /api/payment/process
Body: { booking_id, amount: 5000, payment_type: 'deposit' }

# Payment 2: Balance
POST /api/payment/process
Body: { booking_id, amount: 5000, payment_type: 'balance' }

# Complete booking (both sides)
POST /api/bookings/:id/mark-completed (couple)
POST /api/bookings/:id/mark-completed (vendor)

# Verify: Should show ONE transaction with amount = 10000
# Metadata should show TWO receipts
```

### SQL Verification Queries
```sql
-- Check receipts for booking
SELECT * FROM receipts WHERE booking_id = 'booking-123';

-- Check wallet transaction
SELECT * FROM wallet_transactions WHERE booking_id = 'booking-123';

-- Verify amount matches
SELECT 
  b.id as booking_id,
  (SELECT SUM(amount) FROM receipts WHERE booking_id = b.id) / 100 as total_from_receipts,
  wt.amount as amount_in_wallet
FROM bookings b
LEFT JOIN wallet_transactions wt ON wt.booking_id = b.id
WHERE b.id = 'booking-123';
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Wallet not updated after completion
**Check**:
1. Both vendor AND couple marked complete?
2. Receipts exist in database?
3. Check backend logs in Render
4. Run SQL verification queries

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Manually trigger wallet update
SELECT * FROM receipts WHERE booking_id = 'xxx';
-- Copy receipt amounts and run wallet update
```

### Issue: Amount mismatch
**Cause**: Receipts in centavos, wallet in PHP

**Solution**: Always divide by 100 when reading receipts:
```javascript
const amountPHP = receipt.amount / 100;
```

### Issue: Missing transaction
**Check**: Transaction ID uniqueness
```sql
SELECT * FROM wallet_transactions 
WHERE transaction_id LIKE 'TXN-booking-123%';
```

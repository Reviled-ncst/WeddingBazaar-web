### ðŸŽ¯ **Updated DSS Scoring Algorithm**

The DSS now focuses on the **4 key conditions** you specified:

#### **1. Rating Score (35% - Primary Factor)**
- **4.8-5.0**: "Outstanding rating - Top tier quality"
- **4.5-4.7**: "Exceptional rating - Premium quality" 
- **4.0-4.4**: "High rating - Quality service"
- **3.5-3.9**: "Good rating - Reliable service"

#### **2. Booking Popularity (25% - Based on Review Count)**
- **200+ estimated bookings**: "High demand vendor"
- **100+ estimated bookings**: "Popular vendor"
- **50+ estimated bookings**: "Established vendor"
- *Formula*: `estimated_bookings = review_count Ã— 4`

#### **3. Price Compatibility (30% - Budget Alignment)**
- **â‰¤50% of budget**: "Excellent value" (30 points)
- **51-70% of budget**: "Good value" (25 points)
- **71-90% of budget**: "Fair value" (20 points)
- **91-100% of budget**: "At budget limit" (15 points)
- **>100% of budget**: "Over budget - consider if essential" (5 points)

#### **4. Additional Factors (10% - Location, Availability, Features)**
- **Location match**: +4 points
- **Available for booking**: +3 points
- **Comprehensive services**: +3 points (3+ specialties)

### ðŸ“Š **Scoring Breakdown**
```
Total Score = Rating(35%) + Bookings(25%) + Price(30%) + Additional(10%)

Priority Levels:

  COUNT(r.id) as total_receipts,
  SUM(r.amount) as total_paid
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON b.couple_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN receipts r ON r.booking_id = CAST(b.id AS TEXT)
WHERE u.id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
GROUP BY u.email;
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: No transactions showing

**Possible Causes**:
1. User has no receipts in database
2. User ID mismatch
3. Database query failing

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Check receipts for user
SELECT * FROM receipts r
JOIN bookings b ON r.booking_id = CAST(b.id AS TEXT)
WHERE b.couple_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```

### Issue: Statistics not accurate

**Possible Causes**:
1. Receipts not properly linked to bookings
2. Amount calculation error

**Solution**:
- Check backend logs
- Verify receipt amounts are in centavos
- Check booking-receipt relationships

### Issue: Search not working

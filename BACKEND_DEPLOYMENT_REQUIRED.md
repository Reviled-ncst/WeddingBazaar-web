# Backend Deployment Required - Quote Itemization Fix

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Backend Not Deployed

The frontend has been deployed with the fix, but **backend is still running old code**.

## Evidence from Logs

```
2025-10-21T02:36:28 "GET /bookings/1761013430/quote HTTP/1.1" 404 164
```

The backend is returning 404 because:
1. The endpoint `/api/bookings/:id/quote` doesn't exist
2. The `/api/bookings/enhanced` endpoint doesn't include `quote_itemization` in SELECT query

## Backend Changes That Need Deployment

### File: `backend-deploy/routes/bookings.cjs`

**Line 525** - GET `/api/bookings/enhanced` endpoint:
```javascript
SELECT 
  b.id,
  b.service_name,
  b.vendor_name,
  b.quoted_price,        // ✅ Added
  b.quoted_deposit,      // ✅ Added
  b.quote_itemization,   // ✅ Added - THIS IS THE KEY FIELD
  // ... other fields
FROM bookings b
```

## 🚀 Deploy Backend NOW

### Option 1: Manual Deploy via Render Dashboard
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find `weddingbazaar-web` service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

### Option 2: Trigger Deploy via Git Push
```bash
# Make a trivial change to trigger deployment
echo "# Backend deployment trigger" >> backend-deploy/README.md
git add backend-deploy/README.md
git commit -m "chore: Trigger backend deployment for quote_itemization fix"
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Verify Current Deployment
```bash
# Check if backend has latest code
curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/bookings/enhanced?coupleId=1-2025-001 | jq '.bookings[0] | keys'
```

Expected output should include: `"quote_itemization"`

## ✅ How to Verify Deployment Succeeded

### 1. Check Render Logs
Look for this in deployment logs:
```
==> Build successful 🎉
==> Deploying...
==> Your service is live 🎉
```

### 2. Test API Endpoint
```bash
curl -s "https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/bookings/enhanced?coupleId=1-2025-001" \
  | jq '.bookings[0].quote_itemization'
```

Expected: Should return the JSON object with serviceItems array, NOT null

### 3. Test in Frontend
1. Hard refresh: https://weddingbazaarph.web.app (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Navigate to Bookings
3. Click "View Quote" on Flower booking
4. Check console logs for:
   ```
   ✅ [QuoteModal] Successfully parsed quote_itemization
   ✅ [QuoteModal] Transformed quote data with 7 service items
   ```

## 📊 Current Status

**Frontend:** ✅ DEPLOYED (latest code with `quote_itemization` parsing)  
**Backend:** ❌ NOT DEPLOYED (missing `quote_itemization` in SQL SELECT)  
**Database:** ✅ HAS DATA (quote_itemization field exists with 7 service items)  

## ⏱️ Expected Resolution Time

- Manual deploy via Render: **2-3 minutes**
- Auto-deploy via git push: **5-7 minutes**
- Verification: **30 seconds**

**Total: 3-8 minutes to fix**

## 🐛 Why This Happened

The backend SQL query was updated locally and committed, but Render hasn't pulled and deployed the latest code yet. Render auto-deploys on git push, but there may be:
1. Deployment delay
2. Build queue
3. Manual deploy required
4. Webhook not triggering

**NEXT ACTION:** Go to Render dashboard and manually trigger deployment NOW.

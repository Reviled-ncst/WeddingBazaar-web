# ✅ VENDOR BOOKINGS PRICE RANGE - DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: 🚀 **DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION**  
**URL**: https://weddingbazaarph.web.app

## 🎯 WHAT WAS DONE

### **Enhanced Vendor Bookings Price Display**

Vendors now see **price ranges** prominently displayed instead of just a single total amount, providing better context for pricing and negotiations.

---

## 📸 VISUAL SUMMARY

### Before:
```
Total Amount: ₱60,000  ← Single value only
```

### After:
```
Price Range: ₱50,000 - ₱75,000  ← Prominent range
  Final quoted: ₱60,000         ← Context
```

## 🔄 DISPLAY LOGIC (Priority Order)

1. **Show Estimated Cost Range** (if available)
   - Display: "Price Range: ₱X - ₱Y"
   - Secondary: "Final quoted: ₱Z" (if applicable)

2. **Show Client Budget** (if no estimated cost)
   - Display: "Client Budget: [range]"
   - Secondary: "Your quote: ₱Z" (if applicable)

3. **Show Single Amount** (fallback)
   - Display: "Amount: ₱X" or "TBD"

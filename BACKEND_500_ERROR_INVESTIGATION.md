# 🔍 Backend Deployment Check - Service Endpoint 500 Error

## Status: ⏳ INVESTIGATING

---

## 📊 Current Error

**Error:** `Service not found (500)`  
**Previous:** `Service not found (404)`

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Error changed from 404 → 500 (endpoint now exists!)
- ⚠️ 500 error indicates server-side issue
- Likely causes:
  1. Render deployment still in progress
  2. Database query syntax error
  3. Missing database table/column

---

## 🔧 Possible Issues

### Issue 1: Render Deployment Timing
The deployment may not be complete yet. Render needs:
- Build time: ~30-60 seconds
- Deploy time: ~30-60 seconds
- Total: ~1-2 minutes from push

### Issue 2: SQL Template Literal Syntax
The new endpoint uses template literals which may need adjustment:

**Current code:**
```javascript
const services = await sql`
  SELECT * FROM services 
  WHERE id = ${id}
`;
```

**May need to be:**
```javascript
const services = await sql('SELECT * FROM services WHERE id = $1', [id]);
```

### Issue 3: Column Names
The `total_reviews` column may not exist in vendors table.

## ✅ Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Wait for Render Deployment
**Wait 2-3 more minutes** and try again. Render auto-deploy takes time.

**Check deployment status:**
https://dashboard.render.com/web/weddingbazaar-web

### Option 2: Test API Directly
Once Render shows "Deploy succeeded", test the API:

```bash
curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/services/SRV-0001
```

### Option 3: Check Render Logs
Go to Render dashboard → Logs to see the actual error message.

## 🧪 Testing Timeline

```
Time 0:00 - Git push successful ✅
Time 0:30 - Render starts build ⏳
Time 1:00 - Render deploys code ⏳
Time 1:30 - Backend restarts ⏳
Time 2:00 - Service available ✅
```

**Current Status:** Likely at 0:30-1:00 mark  
**Action:** Wait another 1-2 minutes

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Wait 2 minutes** for Render deployment to complete
2. **Check Render dashboard** for "Deploy succeeded" message
3. **Test API endpoint** directly:
   ```
   https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/services/SRV-0001
   ```
4. **If still 500:** Check Render logs for exact error
5. **Share error logs** so I can fix the query

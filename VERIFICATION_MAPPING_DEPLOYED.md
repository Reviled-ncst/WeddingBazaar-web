# Vendor Verification Field Mapping - DEPLOYED ‚úÖ

**Deployment Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: LIVE IN PRODUCTION

## What Was Fixed

### The Problem
The vendor verification status display was showing incorrect data because:
- Frontend was using **camelCase** field names (e.g., `emailVerified`, `phoneVerified`)
- Backend/Database uses **snake_case** field names (e.g., `email_verified`, `phone_verified`)
- Field sources were incorrect (e.g., checking `profile.emailVerified` when it should be `user.email_verified`)

### The Solution
Fixed all verification field mappings in `VendorProfile.tsx`:

| Verification Type | Correct Database Field | Correct Source Object |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Email Verified | `email_verified` | `user` (from users table) |
| Phone Verified | `phone_verified` | `profile` (from vendor_profiles table) |
| Business Verified | `business_verified` | `profile` (from vendor_profiles table) |
| Documents Verified | `documents_verified` | `profile` (from vendor_profiles table) |

## Deployment Status

### ‚úÖ Frontend (Firebase)
- **URL**: https://weddingbazaarph.web.app
- **Status**: Deployed successfully
- **Build**: Completed in 10.10s
- **Deploy Time**: January 2025
- **Changes**: 
  - VendorProfile.tsx - Fixed all verification field mappings
  - Helper functions updated to use correct field names
  - UI logic corrected for proper verification status display

### ‚úÖ Backend (Render)
- **URL**: https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com
- **Status**: Already deployed (no backend changes needed)
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL - schema confirmed correct

### ‚úÖ Git Repository
- **Commit**: `f5eee35` - "Fix vendor verification field mapping - align with database schema"
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Pushed**: January 2025

## Database Schema (Confirmed Correct)

### users table
```sql
- id (UUID)
- email (VARCHAR)
- email_verified (BOOLEAN) ‚úÖ Used for email verification status
- phone_verified (BOOLEAN) ‚úÖ Used for phone verification status
- firebase_uid (VARCHAR)
- full_name (VARCHAR)
- role (VARCHAR)
```

### vendor_profiles table
```sql
- id (UUID)
- user_id (UUID -> references users.id)
- business_name (VARCHAR)
- business_type (VARCHAR)
- phone_verified (BOOLEAN) ‚úÖ Used for phone verification status
- business_verified (BOOLEAN) ‚úÖ Used for business verification status
- documents_verified (BOOLEAN) ‚úÖ Used for documents verification status
- verification_status (VARCHAR) - overall status
```

## Code Changes

### VendorProfile.tsx - Before and After

**BEFORE (Incorrect):**
```typescript
// ‚ùå Wrong field names and sources
const emailVerified = profile?.emailVerified || false;
const phoneVerified = profile?.phoneVerified || false;
const businessVerified = profile?.verification?.business?.length > 0;
const documentsVerified = profile?.verification?.documents?.length > 0;
```

**AFTER (Correct):**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Correct field names and sources
const emailVerified = user?.email_verified || false;
const phoneVerified = profile?.phone_verified || false;
const businessVerified = profile?.business_verified || false;
const documentsVerified = profile?.documents_verified || false;
```

# üéØ SendQuoteModal Redesign Plan

## Current Issues
1. **Confusing preset packages** - Unclear what items are included, duplicate service types
2. **Poor template system** - Generic items don't match actual vendor services
3. **Cramped UI** - Too much information, hard to navigate
4. **Complex workflow** - Vendors struggle to create quotes quickly
5. **Unclear pricing** - No visual hierarchy, hard to understand costs

## Redesign Goals
1. **Simplified Quick Start** - 3 simple package options with clear pricing
2. **Visual Package Builder** - Card-based selection system
3. **Smart Defaults** - Auto-populate based on booking details (guest count, date, etc.)
4. **Clear Customization** - Easy to add/remove items and adjust prices
5. **Professional Output** - Beautiful quote preview before sending

## New Design Structure

### 1. Package Selection (Step 1)
- **Quick Select Cards** (3 options):
  - ü•â **Essential Package** - Basic coverage, good for small weddings
  - ü•à **Complete Package** ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED - Full coverage, most popular
  - ü•á **Premium Package** - Luxury experience, full service

- Each card shows:
  - Price range
  - Key features (4-5 main items)
  - Best for: "Perfect for weddings with 50-100 guests"
  - Visual icon/image

### 2. Customize Items (Step 2)
- **Grid of Service Cards** - Check/uncheck items
  - Each card shows: Icon, Name, Description, Price
  - Organized by category (Equipment, Services, Add-ons)
  - Search/filter functionality

### 3. Quote Details (Step 3)
- **Summary Panel** (always visible on right)
  - Selected items with qty/price
  - Subtotal, tax, total
  - Payment schedule visualization

- **Additional Details**:
  - Personal message to couple
  - Validity date
  - Payment terms
  - Terms & conditions

### 4. Preview & Send (Step 4)
- Beautiful PDF-style preview
- Final review before sending
- One-click send

## Implementation Plan

   - `PackageSelectionStep.tsx`
   - `CustomizeItemsStep.tsx`
   - `QuoteDetailsStep.tsx`
   - `QuotePreviewStep.tsx`

2. Simplify data structures:
   - Remove complex preset packages

   - Use actual service data from booking

3. Improve UX:
   - Step-by-step wizard
   - Progress indicator
   - Autosave draft quotes
   - Mobile-responsive design

## Timeline

- Phase 3: Deploy & monitor (30 min)

## Success Metrics

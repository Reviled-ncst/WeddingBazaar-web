# DSS UI Terminology Fix Complete ✅

**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION  

---

## 🎯 Issue Identified
The Decision Support System (DSS) was using "AI" terminology in the modal UI, even though:
1. The button label was already updated to "Smart Planner" 
2. The system uses algorithmic scoring, not AI/ML
3. This was misleading to users about the nature of the system

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Frontend Changes
**File:** `src/pages/users/individual/services/dss/DecisionSupportSystem.tsx`

#### Before:
```tsx
<h2>AI Wedding Assistant</h2>
<p>Smart recommendations for your perfect day</p>
```

#### After:
```tsx
<h2>Smart Wedding Planner</h2>
<p>Intelligent recommendations for your perfect day</p>
```

### Key Updates:
- ✅ Modal title: "AI Wedding Assistant" → "Smart Wedding Planner"
- ✅ Subtitle updated to "Intelligent recommendations" (more accurate)
- ✅ Consistent terminology across button and modal
- ✅ Accurately represents the algorithmic nature of the system

## 📊 Verification

### Before Fix:
```
Button: "Smart Planner" 
Modal: "AI Wedding Assistant" ❌ (INCONSISTENT)
```

### After Fix:
```
Button: "Smart Planner"
Modal: "Smart Wedding Planner" ✅ (CONSISTENT)
```

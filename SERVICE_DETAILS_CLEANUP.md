- Text too close together

### Fix:

NEW: p-8 gap-6

OLD: space-y-2
NEW: space-y-4

OLD: text-sm
NEW: text-base (more readable)
```

## 📋 ACTION ITEMS

1. **Remove "Service Information" section** entirely
2. **Remove internal fields**: ID, created_at, updated_at, keywords
3. **Increase spacing**: More padding, gaps, and margins
4. **Keep only public-relevant data**
5. **Make it clean and professional**

---

**Priority**: HIGH
**Impact**: Public share links will look professional, not expose internal data

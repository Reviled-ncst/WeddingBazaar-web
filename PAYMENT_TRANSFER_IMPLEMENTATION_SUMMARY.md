# üí∞ Enhanced Payment Transfer System - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### Problem
The original wallet system was transferring `booking.amount` to vendor wallets, which was just the quoted amount. It wasn't pulling the **actual payment amounts** from the receipts table where PayMongo payment records are stored.

### Solution
Enhanced the two-sided completion system to:
1. **Fetch all receipts** from the receipts table when booking is completed
2. **Calculate actual total paid** from receipt amounts (supports multiple payments)
3. **Transfer real payment amounts** to vendor wallet (not booking amount)
4. **Store complete payment history** in transaction metadata
5. **Track all payment methods** and receipt numbers used

---

## üîÑ Complete Payment Flow

```
1. Customer Makes Payment
   ‚Üì
   PayMongo processes payment
   ‚Üì
   Receipt created in receipts table
   (amount, payment_method, receipt_number, payment_intent_id)
   ‚Üì
   Booking status updated to 'fully_paid'

2. Two-Sided Completion
   ‚Üì
   Couple clicks "Mark as Complete" ‚Üí couple_completed = TRUE
   ‚Üì
   Vendor clicks "Mark as Complete" ‚Üí vendor_completed = TRUE
   ‚Üì
   When BOTH are TRUE, system triggers:

3. Automatic Payment Transfer üéâ
   ‚Üì
   System fetches ALL receipts for booking
   ‚Üì
   Calculates total: Receipt 1 + Receipt 2 + Receipt 3...
   ‚Üì
   Creates wallet transaction with ACTUAL amount
   ‚Üì
   Updates vendor wallet balance
   ‚Üì
   Vendor receives exact amount paid by customer!
```

## üìä Key Features

### 1. Multiple Payment Support
- Customer can pay in parts (deposit, partial, balance)
- System adds up ALL payments automatically
- Example: ‚Ç±5,000 deposit + ‚Ç±5,000 balance = ‚Ç±10,000 transferred

### 2. Payment Method Tracking
- Stores all payment methods used (card, GCash, PayMaya)
- Links to original PayMongo transaction IDs
- Full audit trail in transaction metadata

### 3. Receipt Integration
- Pulls from `receipts` table (source of truth)
- Converts amounts correctly (centavos ‚Üí PHP)
- Stores all receipt numbers for reference

### 4. Fallback Safety
- If no receipts found ‚Üí uses booking.amount
- Logs warning in backend
- Ensures vendors still get paid

## üß™ How to Test

### Step 1: Create Test Booking
```bash
POST /api/bookings
Body: {
  vendor_id: "vendor-uuid",
  service_type: "Photography",
  amount: 10000
}
```

### Step 2: Make Payment
```bash
POST /api/payment/process
Body: {
  booking_id: "booking-uuid",
  amount: 5000,
  payment_type: "deposit"
}
```
**Result**: Receipt created in receipts table

### Step 3: Make Second Payment (Optional)
```bash
POST /api/payment/process
Body: {
  booking_id: "booking-uuid",
  amount: 5000,
  payment_type: "balance"
}
```
**Result**: Second receipt created

### Step 4: Complete Booking (Couple)
```bash
POST /api/bookings/:id/mark-completed
Body: { completed_by: "couple" }
```

### Step 5: Complete Booking (Vendor)
```bash
POST /api/bookings/:id/mark-completed
Body: { completed_by: "vendor" }
```
**Result**: üéâ Payment transferred to wallet!

### Step 6: Verify Wallet
```bash
GET /api/vendor/wallet/balance
```
**Expected**: Balance = ‚Ç±10,000 (5000 + 5000)

### Step 7: Check Transaction
```bash
GET /api/vendor/wallet/transactions
```
**Expected**: One transaction showing:
- Amount: ‚Ç±10,000
- Payment methods: card, gcash (etc.)
- Receipt numbers: RCP-xxx, RCP-yyy
- Metadata with full receipt details

## üîç SQL Verification

Run in Neon SQL Console:

```sql
-- Check receipts
SELECT * FROM receipts WHERE booking_id = 'YOUR_BOOKING_ID';

-- Check wallet transaction
SELECT * FROM wallet_transactions WHERE booking_id = 'YOUR_BOOKING_ID';

-- Verify amounts match
SELECT 
  b.id,
  (SELECT SUM(amount) FROM receipts WHERE booking_id = b.id) / 100 as receipts_total,
  wt.amount as wallet_amount,
  CASE 
    WHEN (SELECT SUM(amount) FROM receipts WHERE booking_id = b.id) / 100 = wt.amount 
    THEN '‚úÖ Match' 
    ELSE '‚ùå Mismatch' 
  END as status
FROM bookings b
LEFT JOIN wallet_transactions wt ON wt.booking_id = b.id
WHERE b.id = 'YOUR_BOOKING_ID';

-- View transaction details with metadata
SELECT 
  transaction_id,
  amount,
  payment_method,
  payment_reference,
  metadata->>'receipts' as receipt_details
FROM wallet_transactions 
WHERE booking_id = 'YOUR_BOOKING_ID';
```

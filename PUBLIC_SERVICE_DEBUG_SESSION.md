# Public Service Endpoint Debug Session

## Timeline

### Issue Discovery
- Public service URL `/service/SRV-0001` returns 500 Internal Server Error
- Service SRV-0001 confirmed to exist in database
- Backend endpoint `GET /api/services/:id` is defined in services.cjs
- Route is correctly registered in production-backend.js as `/api/services`

### Investigation Steps

1. **Database Verification** ✅
   - Confirmed service SRV-0001 exists in database
   - Service has all required fields (title, vendor_id, etc.)
   - Query: `SELECT * FROM services WHERE id = 'SRV-0001'` works locally

2. **Query Testing** ✅
   - Tested multiple SQL query methods (template literal, direct string, LIKE)
   - All methods work correctly in local environment
   - Issue is specific to production environment

3. **Route Order Check** ✅
   - Verified route ordering in services.cjs
   - Routes are: `/` → `/vendor/:vendorId` → `/:id`
   - No conflicts detected (vendor route has specific prefix)

4. **Code Deployment** ✅
   - Latest commit: `90d619e trigger: Force Render deployment`
   - Confirmed pushed to origin/main
   - Render auto-deploy should have triggered

### Current Status
- Added enhanced logging to public service endpoint
- New commit: `84d7c2e debug: Add enhanced logging to public service endpoint`
- Pushed to GitHub to trigger Render redeploy
- Waiting for Render deployment to complete

### Enhanced Logging Added
```javascript
- Request URL, method, and service ID
- SQL query execution status
- Query result count
- Vendor fetch status
- Detailed error logging with stack traces
```

### Next Steps
1. Wait for Render deployment (2-3 minutes)
2. Test endpoint: `GET https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/services/SRV-0001`
3. Check Render logs for detailed error information
4. Fix specific production issue based on log output

### Possible Causes
- Database connection issue in production
- SQL query syntax incompatibility with production environment
- @neondatabase/serverless package version mismatch
- Environment variable issue (DATABASE_URL)
- Render cold start / timeout issue

## Test Commands

```bash
# Test local database
node check-services.cjs

# Test production endpoint
curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/services/SRV-0001

# Check recent commits
git log --oneline -5
```

## Expected Resolution
Once Render deployment completes, the enhanced logging will reveal the exact error occurring in production, allowing us to implement a targeted fix.

## üì¶ BACKEND DEPLOYMENT (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Database Backup (5 minutes)
```bash

pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_before_verification_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

- [ ] Database backup created
- [ ] Backup file size > 0 bytes
- [ ] Backup location noted: ___________________________

### Step 2: Run Database Migration (5 minutes)
```bash
# Connect to database
psql $DATABASE_URL

# Run migration
\i backend-deploy/migrations/001_create_verification_tables.sql

# Verify tables created
\dt user_verifications
\dt verification_audit_log

# Check new columns in users table
\d users

# Exit psql
\q
```

- [ ] `user_verifications` table created
- [ ] `verification_audit_log` table created

-- Run these queries to verify
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_verifications;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM verification_audit_log;
SELECT * FROM verification_statistics;
```

Expected results:
- [ ] `user_verifications` table accessible (0 rows initially)
- [ ] `verification_audit_log` table accessible (0 rows initially)
- [ ] `verification_statistics` view shows all zeros

### Step 4: Update Environment Variables (5 minutes)

**In Render Dashboard:**

```

- [ ] `JWT_SECRET` added (32+ characters)
- [ ] Email variables added (optional)
- [ ] `FRONTEND_URL` set to production URL
- [ ] Variables saved in Render

**Generate JWT_SECRET:**
```bash
# Option 1: Use Node.js
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# Option 2: Use OpenSSL
openssl rand -hex 32

# Option 3: Use online generator
# Visit: https://generate-secret.vercel.app
```

Paste generated JWT_SECRET here for reference:
```
JWT_SECRET=___________________________________
```

### Step 5: Deploy Backend (10 minutes)
```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add identity verification system with JWT auth and admin review"

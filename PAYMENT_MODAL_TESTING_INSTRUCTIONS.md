   ```

7. **Click on a Paid Plan** (Premium, Pro, or Enterprise)

## 📋 Expected Console Output

### Scenario A: Everything Working ✅

```javascript
// When page loads
🔍 [UpgradePrompt] Checking PayMongoPaymentModal render condition: { hasSelectedPlan: false, paymentModalOpen: false, selectedPlanName: undefined }

// When you click Premium plan
🎯 [UpgradePrompt] handleUpgradeClick called { planName: "Premium", planPrice: 5, isProcessing: false }
🚀 [UpgradePrompt] Opening payment modal for Premium
💰 [UpgradePrompt] Amount to charge: ₱5.00 (PHP)
📋 [UpgradePrompt] Setting selectedPlan and paymentModalOpen=true
✅ [UpgradePrompt] Payment modal state updated
📊 [UpgradePrompt] Payment Modal State Changed: { paymentModalOpen: true, selectedPlanName: "Premium", selectedPlanPrice: 5, timestamp: "2025-10-27..." }
🔍 [UpgradePrompt] Checking PayMongoPaymentModal render condition: { hasSelectedPlan: true, paymentModalOpen: true, selectedPlanName: "Premium" }
💳 [PayMongoPaymentModal] render: { isOpen: true, booking: {...} }

// Payment modal should be visible!
```

### Scenario B: Modal Not Rendering ❌

```javascript
// When you click Premium plan
🎯 [UpgradePrompt] handleUpgradeClick called { planName: "Premium", planPrice: 5, isProcessing: false }
🚀 [UpgradePrompt] Opening payment modal for Premium
💰 [UpgradePrompt] Amount to charge: ₱5.00 (PHP)
📋 [UpgradePrompt] Setting selectedPlan and paymentModalOpen=true
✅ [UpgradePrompt] Payment modal state updated
📊 [UpgradePrompt] Payment Modal State Changed: { paymentModalOpen: true, selectedPlanName: "Premium", selectedPlanPrice: 5, timestamp: "2025-10-27..." }

```

## 🔍 Additional Debugging

### Check 1: Is the Modal in the DOM?

Open Elements tab in DevTools and search for:
- "z-[999999]"
- "PayMongo"
- "fixed inset-0"

If you find it but it's hidden, that's a CSS issue.
If you don't find it, that's a component rendering issue.

### Check 2: React DevTools

1. Install React Developer Tools extension
2. Open React DevTools tab
3. Search for "PayMongoPaymentModal"
4. Check if it exists in the component tree
5. Check its props (especially `isOpen`)

### Check 3: Check for Errors

Look for any errors in the console (red text).
Common errors:
- Import errors
- Prop type errors
- Rendering errors

## 🚀 What Happens Next

### If Payment Modal Works ✅

**You'll see**:
- Payment modal overlay appears
- Payment method selection (Card, GCash, etc.)
- Ability to enter payment details
- Process subscription upgrade payment

**Next Steps**:
1. Try completing a payment with the test card
2. Verify subscription upgrades correctly
3. Verify service limits update to "Unlimited"

### If Payment Modal Doesn't Work ❌

**I Need From You**:
1. Screenshot of browser console logs
2. Screenshot of React DevTools (showing component tree)
3. Any error messages you see

**Based on the logs, I can**:
1. Identify if it's a state management issue
2. Identify if it's a component rendering issue
3. Identify if it's a CSS/z-index issue
4. Provide a targeted fix

## 💡 Quick Test Without Upgrading

If you just want to see if the modal works without testing the full flow:

1. Open browser console
2. Paste this code:
   ```javascript
   // Force open the payment modal (temporary test)
   const event = new CustomEvent('openPaymentModal', {
     detail: { plan: 'premium', price: 5 }
   });
   window.dispatchEvent(event);
   ```

This won't actually work in the current implementation, but it shows the debugging approach.

## 📞 Report Back

Please share:

1. **Did the upgrade modal open?** (the one showing the plans)
2. **Did you click on a plan?** (Premium/Pro/Enterprise)
3. **What console logs did you see?** (copy/paste or screenshot)
4. **Did the payment modal appear?** (yes/no)
5. **Any errors in console?** (red text)

Based on your findings, I can provide the exact fix needed!

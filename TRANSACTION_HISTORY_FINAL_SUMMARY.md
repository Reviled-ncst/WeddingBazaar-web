---

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
**File**: `src/pages/users/individual/transaction-history/TransactionHistory.tsx`

**Flow**:
1. User logs in ‚Üí AuthContext provides `user.id`
2. Page loads ‚Üí `useEffect` calls `loadTransactionHistory()`
3. Single API call ‚Üí `GET /api/payment/receipts/user/${user.id}`
4. Receive receipts + statistics ‚Üí Update state
5. Render cards and statistics

**Key Features**:
- Statistics cards (total spent, payments, bookings, vendors)
- Transaction cards with receipt details
- Search by vendor/service/receipt number
- Filter by payment method (card, GCash, PayMaya, GrabPay)
- Filter by payment type (deposit, balance, full)
- Sort by date/amount/vendor
- Expand/collapse receipt details
- Mobile responsive design

### Backend
**File**: `backend-deploy/routes/payments.cjs`

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/payment/receipts/user/:userId`

**SQL Query**:
```sql
SELECT 
  r.id, r.booking_id, r.receipt_number, r.payment_type,
  r.amount, r.currency, r.payment_method, r.payment_intent_id,
  r.paid_by, r.paid_by_name, r.paid_by_email,
  r.total_paid, r.remaining_balance, r.notes, r.metadata,
  r.created_at,
  b.amount as booking_total, b.service_type, b.event_date,
  b.event_location, b.status as booking_status,
  b.vendor_id, b.couple_id,
  v.business_name as vendor_business_name,
  v.business_type as vendor_category,
  v.rating as vendor_rating
FROM receipts r
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON r.booking_id = CAST(b.id AS TEXT)
LEFT JOIN vendors v ON b.vendor_id = v.id
WHERE b.couple_id = ${userId}
ORDER BY r.created_at DESC
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "receipts": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "bookingId": "booking-uuid",
      "receiptNumber": "WB-2025-001",

## Database Schema

### Tables Involved

**1. receipts** (payment receipts)
```sql
- id (UUID)
- booking_id (TEXT) - References bookings.id
- receipt_number (VARCHAR) - e.g., "WB-2025-001"
- payment_type (VARCHAR) - deposit, balance, full
- amount (INTEGER) - Amount in centavos
- currency (VARCHAR) - PHP
- payment_method (VARCHAR) - card, gcash, paymaya, grab_pay
- payment_intent_id (VARCHAR) - PayMongo intent ID
- paid_by (UUID) - References users.id
- paid_by_name (VARCHAR)
- paid_by_email (VARCHAR)
- total_paid (INTEGER) - Running total
- remaining_balance (INTEGER)
- notes (TEXT)
- metadata (JSONB)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

**2. bookings** (wedding bookings)
```sql
- id (UUID)
- couple_id (UUID) - References users.id ‚≠ê KEY FIELD
- vendor_id (UUID) - References vendors.id
- service_id (UUID)
- service_type (VARCHAR)
- event_date (DATE)
- event_location (VARCHAR)
- status (VARCHAR)
- amount (INTEGER)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

**3. vendors** (wedding vendors)
```sql

## Key Relationships

```
User (couple) ‚Üí bookings.couple_id ‚Üí Booking
Booking ‚Üí receipts.booking_id ‚Üí Receipt(s)
Booking ‚Üí bookings.vendor_id ‚Üí Vendor
```

**Join Logic**:
```sql
receipts.booking_id = CAST(bookings.id AS TEXT)
bookings.vendor_id = vendors.id
bookings.couple_id = users.id
```

**Filter**: `WHERE bookings.couple_id = :userId`

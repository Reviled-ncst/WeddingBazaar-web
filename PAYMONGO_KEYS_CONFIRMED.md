**Expected output:**
```
VITE v5.x.x  ready in XXX ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

### Step 3: Test Payment Health Check

```powershell
# In a third terminal
curl http://localhost:3001/api/payment/health
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "paymongo_configured": true,

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

Before testing, confirm:

```
□ Backend server is running (cd backend-deploy && npm run dev)
□ Frontend server is running (npm run dev)
□ Backend logs show: "Secret Key: ✅ Available"
□ Backend logs show: "Public Key: ✅ Available"
□ Can access: http://localhost:5173
□ Can access: http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

During payment test, verify:

```
□ Payment modal opens
□ Card form accepts: 4343 4343 4343 4343
□ Console shows "CARD PAYMENT - REAL" (not simulation)
□ Payment takes 3-5 seconds (real API calls)
□ Console shows PayMongo IDs (pi_xxx, pm_xxx)
□ Payment succeeds
□ Receipt number displays (WB-2025-XXXX)
□ Booking status updates to "Deposit Paid"
```

## 🎯 What Makes This REAL (Not Simulation)?

### Before (Simulation):
```javascript
❌ Fake delay: await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1500))
❌ Fake ID: const fakeId = `card_${Date.now()}`
❌ No API calls
❌ Instant completion
```

### Now (Real PayMongo):
```javascript
✅ Real API: fetch('/api/payment/create-intent')
✅ Real IDs: pi_1A2B3C4D5E6F... (from PayMongo)
✅ Real tokenization: Card details sent to PayMongo
✅ Real processing: 3-5 second actual API calls
✅ Real receipts: Stored in database with PayMongo transaction ID
```

## 📊 Success Indicators

### ✅ You Know It's Working When:

1. **Console Shows "REAL"**
   ```

   ```

3. **Backend Logs Show API Calls**
   ```
   💳 [CREATE-INTENT] PayMongo API response status: 200

5. **Receipt Has Real Data**
   ```sql
   SELECT paymongo_payment_id FROM receipts WHERE id = 'latest';
   -- Result: pi_1A2B3C4D5E6F... (real PayMongo ID)
   ```

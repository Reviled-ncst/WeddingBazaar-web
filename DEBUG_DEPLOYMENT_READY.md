# 🎯 FINAL DEBUG DEPLOYMENT - Token Diagnostics Added

## ✅ What Was Deployed

**New comprehensive token debugging** to identify why the JWT token is not found.

### Changes Made:
1. Added `allKeys = Object.keys(localStorage)` logging
2. Checks FOUR possible token keys with detailed logging:
   - `auth_token` (primary)
   - `token` (fallback 1)
   - `jwt_token` (fallback 2)
   - `sessionToken` (fallback 3)
3. Shows which key was found (if any)
4. Shows user-friendly alert if no token found
5. Lists all available localStorage keys

## 🧪 TEST INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Clear Cache AGAIN
**CRITICAL:** You must clear cache to get the new bundle!

**Option A: Hard Refresh**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
- Or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)

**Option B: Incognito Mode** (RECOMMENDED)
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + N`
- Navigate to https://weddingbazaarph.web.app

### Step 2: Login and Test Upgrade

1. Login as vendor
2. Navigate to services page
3. Click "Upgrade" button
4. Select a plan
5. Complete payment with test card: `4343434343434345`
6. **Watch console for NEW debug logs:**

### Step 3: Look for These NEW Logs

```javascript
📥 Step 4: Getting backend JWT token from localStorage...
🔍 [DEBUG] All localStorage keys: [array of keys]  ← NEW!
🔍 [DEBUG] Checking auth_token: ✅ Found or ❌ NOT FOUND  ← NEW!
🔍 [DEBUG] Checking token (fallback): ✅ Found or ❌ NOT FOUND  ← NEW!
🔍 [DEBUG] Checking jwt_token (fallback): ✅ Found or ❌ NOT FOUND  ← NEW!
🔍 [DEBUG] Checking sessionToken (fallback): ✅ Found or ❌ NOT FOUND  ← NEW!
```

### Expected Outcomes:

**Scenario A: Token Found**
```javascript
✅ Step 4: Backend JWT token validated successfully!
✅ Token length: 200 characters
📦 Step 5: Building upgrade payload...
📤 Step 6: Making API call...
📥 Step 7: Response status: 200
✅ Step 8: Successfully upgraded!
```

**Scenario B: Token NOT Found (Current Issue)**
```javascript
❌❌❌ CRITICAL ERROR: No backend JWT token found in localStorage!
❌ Available localStorage keys: ['key1', 'key2', ...]  ← Shows what IS in storage
❌ SOLUTION: Log out and log back in to regenerate the token
```

**Plus an ALERT will appear** telling you to log out/in.

## 🔍 What This Reveals

The debug logs will show us:

1. **All keys in localStorage** - We can see what tokens ARE stored
2. **Which token keys exist** - We can see if token is under different name
3. **Why upgrade fails** - Clear message about missing token

## 📊 Possible Findings

### Finding 1: Token is Under Different Key
If logs show:
```javascript
❌ auth_token: NOT FOUND
❌ token: NOT FOUND
❌ jwt_token: NOT FOUND
✅ sessionToken: Found!  ← Token exists but under different key!
```

**Solution:** Update code to use `sessionToken` key.

### Finding 2: No Token At All
If logs show:
```javascript
❌ All token keys: NOT FOUND
Available keys: ['backend_user', 'firebase_user', ...]  ← No JWT token!
```

**Solution:** User must log out and log back in to regenerate token.

### Finding 3: Token Exists
If logs show:
```javascript
✅ auth_token: Found (length: 200)
```

**Then upgrade should proceed!** If it still fails, the error is elsewhere.

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

**After clearing cache and testing:**

1. **Share the debug logs** showing:
   - All localStorage keys
   - Which token keys were checked
   - Whether any were found

2. **If no token found:**
   - Log out
   - Log back in
   - Check console for `localStorage.setItem('auth_token', ...)`
   - Try upgrade again

3. **If token IS found but upgrade still fails:**
   - Share the full console logs
   - Check Network tab for the API request
   - Look for 401 or other errors

## 📝 Quick Test Script

Run this in console BEFORE testing upgrade:

```javascript
// Check what's in localStorage
console.log('=== BEFORE UPGRADE ===');
console.log('All keys:', Object.keys(localStorage));
console.log('auth_token:', localStorage.getItem('auth_token') ? 'EXISTS' : 'MISSING');
console.log('token:', localStorage.getItem('token') ? 'EXISTS' : 'MISSING');
console.log('jwt_token:', localStorage.getItem('jwt_token') ? 'EXISTS' : 'MISSING');
console.log('sessionToken:', localStorage.getItem('sessionToken') ? 'EXISTS' : 'MISSING');
```

**Status:** 🟢 DEBUG BUILD DEPLOYED  
**Bundle:** `index-CuQmeqwj.js` (NEW)  
**Deployment:** Live at https://weddingbazaarph.web.app  
**Next:** Clear cache, test, and share debug logs  

**This will finally reveal exactly what's wrong with the token! 🔍**

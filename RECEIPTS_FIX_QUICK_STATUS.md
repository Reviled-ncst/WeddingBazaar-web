## What Changed in the Code?

### BEFORE (Broken)
```sql
SELECT 
  r.*,                      -- ❌ Too broad
  b.couple_name,            -- ❌ Doesn't exist
  b.remaining_balance       -- ❌ Doesn't exist
FROM receipts r
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON r.booking_id = b.id
```

### AFTER (Fixed)
```sql
SELECT 
  r.id, r.receipt_number, r.amount_paid,  -- ✅ Explicit columns
  b.service_name, b.total_amount,         -- ✅ Existing columns
  v.business_name,                        -- ✅ From vendors
  u.full_name as couple_name,             -- ✅ From users table!
  u.email as couple_email                 -- ✅ From users table!
FROM receipts r
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON r.booking_id = b.id
LEFT JOIN vendors v ON r.vendor_id = v.id
LEFT JOIN users u ON r.couple_id = u.id   -- ✅ NEW JOIN!
```

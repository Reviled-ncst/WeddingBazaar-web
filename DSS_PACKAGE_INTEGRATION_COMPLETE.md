```

**Updated Modal**:

{showDSS && (
  <PackageDSS
    services={filteredServices.map(convertToBookingService)}
    budget={50000}
    location={locationFilter}
    isOpen={showDSS}
    onClose={handleCloseDSS}
    onBookService={(serviceId: string) => {
      const service = filteredServices.find(s => s.id === serviceId);
      if (service) handleBookingRequest(service);
    }}
    onMessageVendor={(serviceId: string) => {
      const service = filteredServices.find(s => s.id === serviceId);
      if (service) handleMessageVendor(service);
    }}
  />
)}
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Component Props
```typescript
interface PackageDSSProps {
  services: Service[];           // All available services
  budget?: number;               // User's budget (default: 100000)
  location?: string;             // Preferred location
  isOpen: boolean;               // Modal visibility
  onClose: () => void;           // Close handler
  onBookService: (serviceId: string) => void;   // Booking handler
  onMessageVendor: (serviceId: string) => void; // Messaging handler
}
```

### Package Creation Algorithm
1. **Group services** by category (Venue, Catering, Photography, etc.)
2. **Select top services** from each category based on rating and match score
3. **Calculate package totals** with discount tiers
4. **Assign match scores** based on budget, location, and preferences
5. **Sort packages** by match score, price, or savings

## 🔧 Backend Deployment Fix Status

### ✅ Local Backend Working
- **URL**: http://localhost:3001/api/conversations/individual/1-2025-001
- **Status**: ✅ WORKING - Returns 8 conversations
- **Response**: Success with real conversation data

### ❌ Production Backend Issue  
- **URL**: https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/conversations/individual/1-2025-001
- **Status**: ❌ 404 NOT FOUND
- **Issue**: Latest server code not deployed to Render

### 🚀 Solution: Force Backend Deployment
The issue is that Render didn't pick up the latest backend changes. Need to:
1. ✅ Remove server/ from .gitignore (DONE)
2. ✅ Force push server files (DONE)  
3. 🔄 Wait for Render deployment completion
4. ✅ Test production endpoint

### 📝 Next Steps
- The backend deployment on Render should complete within 5-10 minutes
- The frontend at https://weddingbazaarph.web.app should start working once backend is updated
- All conversations will display properly once API endpoint is live

## 📊 New Features & Enhancements

### 1. **RecommendationReason Interface** ✨

```typescript
interface RecommendationReason {
  icon: string;          // Visual indicator (⭐, 💰, 🏆, etc.)
  type: string;          // quality | experience | price | location | priority
  title: string;         // Short title
  description: string;   // Detailed explanation
  weight: number;        // Scoring weight (0-1)
  score: number;         // Reason score (0-100)
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear visual categorization
- Transparent scoring methodology
- Detailed reasoning for users
- Weight-based importance ranking

### 2. **Enhanced Metrics** 📈

```typescript
interface DSSRecommendation {
  // ...existing fields
  matchPercentage: number;      // 0-100% overall compatibility
  costEfficiency: number;       // 0-100% value for money
  qualityScore: number;         // 0-100% service quality
  popularityScore: number;      // 0-100% market demand
  aiInsight: string;            // AI-generated summary
}
```

**Match Percentage Factors** (5 points):
1. ✅ Quality (rating ≥4.0)
2. ✅ Experience (years ≥3)
3. ✅ Verification status
4. ✅ Budget compatibility
5. ✅ Location match

### 3. **AI Insight Generation** 🤖

Intelligent, context-aware insights based on:
- **Quality**: Top-tier / Highly rated service
- **Experience**: Seasoned professional / Solid track record
- **Value**: Exceptional value / Great cost-efficiency
- **Popularity**: Highly sought-after / High demand
- **Priority**: Strongly recommended for wedding

**Example AI Insights**:
```
🌟 Top-tier vendor with proven excellence • 💎 Exceptional value - Premium quality at great price
🏆 Seasoned professional with platform verification • 🔥 Highly sought-after vendor in high demand
⭐ Highly rated with consistent quality • 💰 Great cost-efficiency for service level
```

### 4. **Priority Classification** 🎯

```typescript
if (totalScore >= 75) priority = 'high';      // Strong recommendation
else if (totalScore >= 55) priority = 'medium'; // Good option
else priority = 'low';                          // Consider alternatives
```

### 5. **Risk Assessment** ⚠️

```typescript
if (reviewCount < 10 || rating < 3.5) riskLevel = 'high';    // New vendor
else if (reviewCount < 25 || rating < 4.0) riskLevel = 'medium'; // Growing
else riskLevel = 'low';                                        // Established
```

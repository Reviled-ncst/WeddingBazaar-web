# ✅ QUICK FIX SUMMARY - All Booking Fields Now Working

## What Was Wrong?
**Event End Time input field was missing from the form!**

Users could never enter an end time, so it was always saved as NULL.

## What We Fixed?

### 1. Added Event End Time Input ✅
- Form now has **Event Start Time** and **Event End Time** fields
- Both are side-by-side in a nice grid layout
- End time is marked as optional

### 2. Enhanced Confirmation Modal ✅
- Shows start-end time (e.g., "2:00 PM - 6:00 PM")
- Displays venue details under location
- Shows contact person in new card
- All fields beautifully formatted

### 3. Already Had (From Previous Fix) ✅
- Database columns exist
- Backend saves all fields
- API endpoints working

## Result

```json

**Status**: ✅ Fully Deployed and Operational

## Summary of Changes Deployed

### 1. Contact Info Section Removed from Add Service Form
**Before**: The form had a dedicated "Step 3: Contact Information" section with manual input fields for:
- Business Name
- Contact Person
- Email
- Phone Number
- Business Address

**After**: 
- Contact info section completely removed
- Contact data is now automatically sourced from the vendor's profile in the `users` table
- Form is streamlined from 5 steps to 4 steps (or logically reordered)
- No redundant contact input required

### 2. Step Titles and Descriptions Updated
All step titles and descriptions have been updated to reflect the new structure:
- Step 1: Service Details
- Step 2: Pricing & Capacity
- Step 3: Gallery & Description (previously Step 4)
- Step 4: Category-Specific Information (previously Step 5)

### 3. Form State and Validation Updated
- Removed all contact-related fields from `formData` state
- Removed contact-related validation from `validateStep()`
- Removed contact-related error handling
- Updated form submission to use vendor profile data automatically

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **src/pages/users/vendor/services/components/AddServiceForm.tsx**
   - Removed contact info step JSX
   - Updated step navigation logic
   - Removed contact fields from form state
   - Removed contact validation logic
   - Updated step titles and descriptions

### Database Schema
**No database changes required** - Contact info already exists in the `users` table:
```sql
-- Existing users table structure:
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name TEXT,
  phone TEXT,
  business_name TEXT,
  business_address TEXT,
  -- ... other fields
);
```

### Backend Integration
The backend `/api/services` endpoint already handles contact info automatically:
```javascript
// Backend automatically fetches vendor profile data
const vendorProfile = await db.query(
  'SELECT email, name, phone, business_name, business_address FROM users WHERE id = $1',
  [vendorId]
);

// Contact info is merged into service creation
const serviceData = {
  ...requestBody,
  vendor_email: vendorProfile.email,
  vendor_phone: vendorProfile.phone,
  vendor_business_name: vendorProfile.business_name,
  vendor_address: vendorProfile.business_address
};
```

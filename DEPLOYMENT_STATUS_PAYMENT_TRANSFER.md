## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Monitor Render Deployment (2-3 minutes)
```
🌐 Render Dashboard:
https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-YOUR_SERVICE_ID

Status: Auto-deploy should be triggered now
```

**Wait for**:
- ✅ Build started
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Deploy started
- ✅ Deploy successful
- ✅ Service live

---

### 2. Verify Backend Health

Once Render shows "Live", test the health endpoint:

```bash
# PowerShell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/health"

# Expected Response:
# { "status": "ok", "timestamp": "2025-10-30T..." }
```

---

### 3. Test the Payment Transfer Flow

#### Step 1: Create Test Booking
```bash
POST https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/bookings
Body: {
  "vendor_id": "2-2025-001",
  "service_type": "Photography",
  "amount": 10000,
  "event_date": "2025-12-15"
}
```

#### Step 2: Make Test Payment (Deposit)
```bash
POST https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/payment/process
Body: {
  "booking_id": "your-booking-id",
  "amount": 5000,
  "payment_type": "deposit"
}
```
**Result**: Receipt created with RCP-xxx number

#### Step 3: Make Second Payment (Balance)
```bash
POST https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/payment/process
Body: {
  "booking_id": "your-booking-id",
  "amount": 5000,
  "payment_type": "balance"
}
```
**Result**: Second receipt created, booking status → fully_paid

#### Step 4: Mark Complete (Couple)
```bash
POST https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/bookings/:id/mark-completed
Body: { "completed_by": "couple" }
```

#### Step 5: Mark Complete (Vendor)
```bash
POST https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/bookings/:id/mark-completed
Body: { "completed_by": "vendor" }
```
**Expected**: 🎉 Payment transferred to wallet!

#### Step 6: Verify Wallet Balance
```bash
GET https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/vendor/wallet/balance
Authorization: Bearer vendor-jwt-token

# Expected Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "wallet": {
    "total_earnings": 10000.00,
    "available_balance": 10000.00
  }
}
```

#### Step 7: Check Transaction Details
```bash
GET https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/vendor/wallet/transactions

# Expected: Transaction showing:
# - amount: 10000.00
# - payment_method: "card" (or whatever was used)
# - payment_reference: "RCP-xxx, RCP-yyy"
# - metadata with full receipt details
```

### 4. SQL Verification (Neon Console)

Run these queries in Neon SQL Console:

```sql
-- 1. Check receipts were created
SELECT * FROM receipts 
WHERE booking_id = 'YOUR_BOOKING_ID'
ORDER BY created_at;

-- 2. Check wallet transaction was created
SELECT * FROM wallet_transactions 
WHERE booking_id = 'YOUR_BOOKING_ID';

-- 3. Verify amounts match
SELECT 
  b.id as booking_id,
  (SELECT SUM(amount) FROM receipts WHERE booking_id = b.id) / 100 as receipts_total,
  wt.amount as wallet_amount,
  CASE 
    WHEN (SELECT SUM(amount) FROM receipts WHERE booking_id = b.id) / 100 = wt.amount 
    THEN '✅ Match' 
    ELSE '❌ Mismatch' 
  END as verification
FROM bookings b
LEFT JOIN wallet_transactions wt ON wt.booking_id = b.id
WHERE b.id = 'YOUR_BOOKING_ID';

-- 4. View transaction metadata (see receipt details)
SELECT 
  transaction_id,
  amount,
  payment_method,
  payment_reference,
  metadata->>'receipts' as receipt_details,
  created_at
FROM wallet_transactions 
WHERE booking_id = 'YOUR_BOOKING_ID';

-- 5. Check vendor wallet balance
SELECT * FROM vendor_wallets 
WHERE vendor_id = '2-2025-001';
```

## 🔍 What to Look For

### Backend Logs (Render Dashboard → Logs)
```
✅ "💰 Creating wallet transaction for vendor: 2-2025-001"
✅ "📄 Found 2 receipt(s) for booking xxx"
✅ "💵 Total paid from receipts: ₱10000.00 (1000000 centavos)"
✅ "💳 Payment methods used: card"
✅ "📝 Receipt numbers: RCP-xxx, RCP-yyy"
✅ "✅ Wallet transaction created: TXN-xxx"
✅ "✅ Wallet updated. Previous: ₱0.00, Added: ₱10000.00, New: ₱10000.00"
✅ "🎉 Wallet integration complete for booking xxx"
✅ "📊 Summary: 2 payment(s) totaling ₱10000.00 transferred to vendor wallet"
```

### Expected Database State
```
receipts table:
  receipt_number | amount  | payment_type | created_at
  RCP-2025-001   | 500000  | deposit      | 2025-10-30 10:00
  RCP-2025-002   | 500000  | balance      | 2025-10-30 14:00

wallet_transactions table:
  transaction_id  | amount    | payment_reference
  TXN-booking-xxx | 10000.00  | RCP-2025-001, RCP-2025-002

vendor_wallets table:
  vendor_id   | total_earnings | available_balance
  2-2025-001  | 10000.00       | 10000.00
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Deployment Failed on Render
**Check**:
- Render build logs for errors
- Ensure all dependencies in package.json
- Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable set

### Issue: Wallet Not Updated
**Check**:
1. Both vendor AND couple marked complete?
2. Receipts exist in receipts table?
3. Backend logs show wallet creation attempt?
4. Check Render logs for errors

**SQL Check**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE id = 'xxx';
-- Should show: vendor_completed=true, couple_completed=true, status='completed'

SELECT * FROM receipts WHERE booking_id = 'xxx';
-- Should show receipt records

SELECT * FROM wallet_transactions WHERE booking_id = 'xxx';
-- Should show transaction record
```

### Issue: Amount Mismatch
**Cause**: Receipts in centavos, wallet in PHP

**Verify Conversion**:
```sql
SELECT 
  amount as centavos,
  amount / 100 as php
FROM receipts WHERE booking_id = 'xxx';
```

### Issue: No Receipts Found
**Fallback**: System will use booking.amount
**Log**: "⚠️ No receipts found, using booking amount as fallback"

**Fix**: Ensure payments go through /api/payment/process endpoint

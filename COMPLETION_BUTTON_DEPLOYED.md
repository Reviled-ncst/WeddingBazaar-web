## 🎯 How It Works

### Two-Sided Confirmation System

**Step 1**: Either party marks as complete first
- Couple clicks "Mark as Complete" → `couple_completed = TRUE`
- OR Vendor clicks "Mark as Complete" → `vendor_completed = TRUE`
- Status remains "Fully Paid"
- Other party sees "Waiting for [Party] Confirmation" badge

**Step 2**: Other party confirms
- Second party clicks "Mark as Complete"
- Both flags now `TRUE` → System updates status to "completed"
- Booking shows as "Completed ✓" with pink badge and heart icon
- Both parties can now leave reviews

### Database Flow:

```sql
-- Couple marks complete
UPDATE bookings SET 
  couple_completed = TRUE,
  couple_completed_at = NOW()
WHERE id = :bookingId;

-- Vendor marks complete  
UPDATE bookings SET 
  vendor_completed = TRUE,
  vendor_completed_at = NOW()
WHERE id = :bookingId;

-- When BOTH are TRUE
UPDATE bookings SET 
  status = 'completed',
  fully_completed = TRUE,
  fully_completed_at = NOW()
WHERE 
  couple_completed = TRUE AND 
  vendor_completed = TRUE;
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components

**File**: `src/pages/users/individual/bookings/IndividualBookings.tsx`

**Key Functions**:
```typescript
// Handler for marking as complete
const handleMarkComplete = async (booking: Booking) => {
  // Check completion status
  const completionStatus = await checkCompletionStatus(booking.id);
  
  // Show confirmation modal
  setConfirmationModal({
    isOpen: true,
    title: '✅ Complete Booking',
    message: completionStatus?.vendorCompleted
      ? 'The vendor has confirmed. By confirming, booking will be FULLY COMPLETED.'
      : 'Booking will only be fully completed when both you and vendor confirm.',
    onConfirm: async () => {
      const result = await markBookingComplete(booking.id, 'couple');
      if (result.success) {
        setSuccessMessage(result.message);
        await loadBookings();
      }
    }
  });
};
```

**Button Rendering**:
```tsx
{(booking.status === 'fully_paid' || booking.status === 'paid_in_full') && (
  <button
    onClick={() => handleMarkComplete(booking)}
    className="w-full px-3 py-2 bg-gradient-to-r from-green-500 to-emerald-500 
               text-white rounded-lg hover:shadow-lg transition-all 
               hover:scale-105 flex items-center justify-center gap-2"
  >
    <CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4" />
    Mark as Complete
  </button>
)}
```

### Backend Endpoint

**File**: `backend-deploy/routes/booking-completion.cjs`

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/bookings/:bookingId/mark-completed`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "completed_by": "couple",  // or "vendor"

    "vendor_completed_at": "2024-05-15T11:00:00Z",
    "fully_completed_at": "2024-05-15T11:00:00Z"

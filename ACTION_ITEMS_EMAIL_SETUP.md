## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted"

**Fix**:
1. Make sure you're using **App Password**, not regular Gmail password
2. Remove all spaces from app password (should be 16 characters: `abcdefghijklmnop`)
3. Verify 2-Step Verification is enabled on Gmail account
4. Try generating a new app password

### Issue: "‚ö†Ô∏è Email service not configured" in logs

**Fix**:
1. Check variable names are EXACTLY `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` (case-sensitive)
2. Make sure variables are in the correct Render service
3. Redeploy backend after adding variables
4. Check for typos in variable values

### Issue: Email sent but vendor didn't receive it

**Fix**:
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Add sender email to contacts
3. Wait a few minutes (email can be delayed)
4. Check email address in database is correct:
   ```sql
   SELECT vp.business_name, u.email
   FROM vendor_profiles vp
   JOIN users u ON vp.user_id = u.id
   WHERE vp.id = 'vendor-id-here';
   ```

### Issue: Email looks broken or plain text

**Fix**:
1. Try opening in different email client (Gmail web, Outlook, etc.)
2. Check if HTML emails are blocked in email client settings
3. View in "Show original" or "View as HTML" mode
4. Check Render logs for any HTML template errors

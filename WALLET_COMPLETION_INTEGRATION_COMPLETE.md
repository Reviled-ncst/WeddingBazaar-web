# üéâ WALLET INTEGRATION WITH TWO-SIDED COMPLETION SYSTEM

## üéØ OVERVIEW

**Integration Complete**: When a booking is marked as "completed" by BOTH vendor and couple, the system **automatically creates a wallet transaction** and credits the vendor's wallet.

---

## üìä HOW IT WORKS

### The Flow

```
1. Couple marks booking complete
   ‚Üì
2. Vendor marks booking complete  
   ‚Üì
3. System checks: Both confirmed? ‚úÖ
   ‚Üì
4. Update booking status to 'completed'
   ‚Üì
5. üí∞ CREATE WALLET TRANSACTION (NEW!)
   ‚Üì
6. Credit vendor's wallet with booking amount
   ‚Üì
7. Vendor can now see earnings in Finances page
```

### Database Changes

**When Both Confirm**:
```sql
-- 1. Update booking
UPDATE bookings SET
  status = 'completed',
  fully_completed = TRUE,
  fully_completed_at = NOW();

-- 2. Create wallet transaction (NEW!)
INSERT INTO wallet_transactions (
  transaction_id: 'TXN-[booking_id]-[timestamp]',
  vendor_id: '2-2025-001',
  booking_id: 'uuid',
  transaction_type: 'earning',
  amount: 50000.00,
  currency: 'PHP',
  status: 'completed',
  description: 'Booking payment for Photography',
  payment_method: 'card',
  service_category: 'Photography',
  customer_name: 'John Doe',
  event_date: '2025-12-15'
);

-- 3. Update vendor wallet (NEW!)
UPDATE vendor_wallets SET
  total_earnings = total_earnings + 50000.00,
  available_balance = available_balance + 50000.00,
  updated_at = NOW();
```

---

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### File Modified
**`backend-deploy/routes/booking-completion.cjs`** (Lines 120-230)

### New Code Added

**Wallet Transaction Creation**:
```javascript
// Generate unique transaction ID
const transactionId = `TXN-${bookingId}-${Date.now()}`;

// Extract booking details
const bookingAmount = parseFloat(updated.amount || updated.total_amount || 0);
const paymentMethod = updated.payment_method || 'card';
const serviceType = updated.service_type || 'Wedding Service';
const coupleName = updated.couple_name || 'Customer';

// Create transaction record
INSERT INTO wallet_transactions (
  transaction_id,
  vendor_id,
  booking_id,
  transaction_type: 'earning',
  amount,
  currency: 'PHP',
  status: 'completed',
  description,
  payment_method,
  service_category,
  customer_name,
  event_date
);
```

**Wallet Balance Update**:
```javascript
// If wallet exists: Add to balance
UPDATE vendor_wallets SET
  total_earnings = total_earnings + amount,
  available_balance = available_balance + amount;

// If wallet doesn't exist: Create it
INSERT INTO vendor_wallets (
  vendor_id,
  total_earnings: amount,
  available_balance: amount
);
```

### Error Handling
- ‚úÖ **Graceful Degradation**: If wallet transaction fails, booking still completes
- ‚úÖ **Detailed Logging**: All steps logged for debugging
- ‚úÖ **Transaction Safety**: Uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to prevent duplicates

## üß™ TESTING CHECKLIST

### Before Deployment
- [x] Code review completed
- [x] Integration logic tested
- [x] Error handling implemented
- [x] Logging added for debugging
- [x] Graceful degradation verified

### After Deployment (Manual Testing)

#### Test 1: Complete a New Booking
```bash
# 1. Create a test booking (or use existing)
# 2. Mark as fully paid
# 3. Couple marks as complete
POST /api/bookings/{bookingId}/mark-completed
{ "completed_by": "couple" }

# 4. Vendor marks as complete
POST /api/bookings/{bookingId}/mark-completed
{ "completed_by": "vendor" }

# Expected:
# - Booking status changes to 'completed'
# - Wallet transaction created
# - Vendor wallet balance increased
```

#### Test 2: Verify Wallet Transaction
```bash
# Check wallet transactions
GET /api/wallet/2-2025-001/transactions

# Expected Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "transactions": [
    {
      "transaction_id": "TXN-[booking-id]-[timestamp]",
      "transaction_type": "earning",
      "amount": 50000,
      "status": "completed",
      "service_category": "Photography",
      "customer_name": "John Doe",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Test 3: Verify Wallet Balance
```bash
# Check wallet summary
GET /api/wallet/2-2025-001

# Expected Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "wallet": {
    "vendor_id": "2-2025-001",
    "total_earnings": 50000,    # Increased by booking amount
    "available_balance": 50000, # Available to withdraw
    ...
  }
}
```

#### Test 4: Frontend Verification
1. **Couple Side** (IndividualBookings.tsx):
   - Complete a booking
   - See success message
   - Booking shows "Completed ‚úì" badge

2. **Vendor Side** (VendorBookingsSecure.tsx):
   - Complete same booking
   - See "Both confirmed" message
   - Booking status changes to "Completed"

3. **Vendor Finances** (VendorFinances.tsx):
   - Navigate to Finances page
   - See new transaction in history
   - See wallet balance increased

## üîç DEBUGGING GUIDE

### Check Backend Logs (Render)

**Expected Log Output**:
```
üéâ Both sides confirmed! Updating booking abc123 to COMPLETED status
‚úÖ Booking abc123 is now COMPLETED. Status: completed
üí∞ Creating wallet transaction for vendor: 2-2025-001
üí∞ Transaction details: {
  transactionId: 'TXN-abc123-1234567890',
  vendorId: '2-2025-001',
  bookingId: 'abc123',
  amount: 50000,
  serviceType: 'Photography',
  coupleName: 'John Doe',
  paymentMethod: 'card'
}
‚úÖ Wallet transaction created: TXN-abc123-1234567890
üí∞ Updating existing wallet for vendor: 2-2025-001
‚úÖ Wallet updated. Added: ‚Ç±50000
üéâ Wallet integration complete for booking abc123
```

### If Wallet Transaction Fails

**Check for**:
1. `vendor_wallets` table exists
2. `wallet_transactions` table exists
3. Booking has `vendor_id` field
4. Booking has `amount` or `total_amount` field
5. Database connection is working

**Error Handling**:
- Booking still completes even if wallet fails
- Error logged but doesn't block completion
- Admin can manually create transaction later

## üìù MIGRATION FOR EXISTING BOOKINGS

If you have existing completed bookings that don't have wallet transactions:

**Run this SQL in Neon**:
```sql
-- Create transactions for all existing completed bookings
INSERT INTO wallet_transactions (
  transaction_id,
  vendor_id,
  booking_id,
  transaction_type,
  amount,
  currency,
  status,
  description,
  payment_method,
  service_name,
  service_category,
  customer_name,
  event_date,
  created_at,
  updated_at
)
SELECT
  'TXN-' || b.id || '-MIGRATION' as transaction_id,
  b.vendor_id,
  b.id,
  'earning' as transaction_type,
  COALESCE(b.amount, b.total_amount, 0.00) as amount,
  'PHP' as currency,
  'completed' as status,
  'Booking payment for ' || COALESCE(b.service_type, 'service') as description,
  COALESCE(b.payment_method, 'card') as payment_method,
  b.service_type as service_name,
  b.service_type as service_category,
  COALESCE(b.couple_name, b.client_name, 'Customer') as customer_name,
  b.event_date,
  COALESCE(b.fully_completed_at, b.updated_at) as created_at,
  NOW() as updated_at
FROM bookings b
WHERE b.status = 'completed'
  AND b.fully_completed = true
  AND b.vendor_id IS NOT NULL
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM wallet_transactions wt
    WHERE wt.booking_id = b.id
  )
ON CONFLICT (transaction_id) DO NOTHING;

-- Update wallet balances
UPDATE vendor_wallets vw
SET 
  total_earnings = (
    SELECT COALESCE(SUM(amount), 0)
    FROM wallet_transactions wt
    WHERE wt.vendor_id = vw.vendor_id
      AND wt.transaction_type = 'earning'
      AND wt.status = 'completed'
  ),
  available_balance = (
    SELECT COALESCE(SUM(amount), 0)
    FROM wallet_transactions wt
    WHERE wt.vendor_id = vw.vendor_id
      AND wt.transaction_type = 'earning'
      AND wt.status = 'completed'
  ),
  updated_at = NOW();
```

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

You'll know it's working when:

1. ‚úÖ Both sides complete a booking
2. ‚úÖ Booking status changes to 'completed'
3. ‚úÖ Backend logs show wallet creation
4. ‚úÖ Transaction appears in database
5. ‚úÖ Vendor wallet balance increases
6. ‚úÖ Vendor sees transaction in Finances page
7. ‚úÖ No errors in Render logs

---

## üìû SUPPORT

**If wallet transaction doesn't create**:
1. Check Render logs for errors
2. Verify booking has `vendor_id` and `amount`
3. Check wallet tables exist in database
4. Test with SQL migration script above

**Database Queries**:
```sql
-- Check if transaction was created
SELECT * FROM wallet_transactions 
WHERE booking_id = '[your-booking-id]';

-- Check vendor wallet balance
SELECT * FROM vendor_wallets 
WHERE vendor_id = '2-2025-001';

-- Check all completed bookings
SELECT id, vendor_id, status, amount, fully_completed
FROM bookings 
WHERE status = 'completed' 
ORDER BY fully_completed_at DESC;
```

## üìã Pre-Testing Checklist

### ‚úÖ Before You Start:

- [ ] **Render environment variables added:**
  - `EMAIL_USER` = your Gmail address
  - `EMAIL_PASS` = `jlgswrzgyjcckeyq`
  - `FRONTEND_URL` = `https://weddingbazaarph.web.app`

## üß™ Test Scenario 1: Complete Email Flow Test

### Step 1: Identify Test Vendor

**Option A: Use Existing Vendor**

Query in Neon database:
```sql
SELECT 
  vp.id as vendor_id,
  vp.business_name,
  u.email as vendor_email,
  vp.category
FROM vendor_profiles vp
JOIN users u ON vp.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.email IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 5;
```

Pick one vendor and note:
- `vendor_id` (e.g., `2-2025-001`)
- `vendor_email` (e.g., `vendor@example.com`)
- `business_name` (e.g., `Perfect Photos`)

**Option B: Use Your Own Email**

Set a vendor's email to your own Gmail:
```sql
UPDATE users
SET email = 'your-email@gmail.com'
WHERE id = (
  SELECT user_id FROM vendor_profiles 
  WHERE id = '2-2025-001'
);
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

   ```

2. **Gmail "Sent" folder** - Check from EMAIL_USER account

3. **Spam folder** - Check vendor's spam

4. **Email address** - Verify vendor email in database:
   ```sql
   SELECT u.email 
   FROM vendor_profiles vp 
   JOIN users u ON vp.user_id = u.id 
   WHERE vp.id = 'vendor-id';
   ```

5. **Wait time** - Can take 2-5 minutes sometimes

### Issue: Email in Spam

**Solutions:**

1. Mark as "Not Spam" in Gmail

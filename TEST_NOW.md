# 🎯 QUICK TEST - Subscription Upgrade Fixed

## What Changed
Fixed 3 API endpoints to call backend directly instead of Firebase:
✅ `/api/subscriptions/upgrade` → `https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/subscriptions/upgrade`
✅ `/api/subscriptions/upgrade-with-payment` → `https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/subscriptions/upgrade-with-payment`

## Test NOW (2 minutes)
1. Go to https://weddingbazaarph.web.app
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (hard refresh)
3. Open console (F12)
4. Login → Vendor Services → Upgrade
5. Select plan → Pay (card: 4343434343434345)
6. Watch console

## Success Indicators
Look for these in console:
```
✅ 🌐 Full API URL: https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/...
✅ 📄 Response body as text: {"success":true,...
✅ 🔍 Content-Type: application/json
✅ ✅✅✅ Step 7.5: JSON parsing COMPLETE!
✅ 🎊🎊🎊 Step 8: ENTERING SUCCESS HANDLER...
✅ 📊 Step 8: New Plan: premium
```

## What Fixed It
**Before**: Firebase served HTML when frontend called `/api/...`  
**After**: Frontend calls backend directly at `https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/...`

## If It Works
- Subscription tier updates
- Service limit increases
- Can add more services
- 🎉 Bug is FIXED!

## Report Back
Share console screenshot showing:
- "Full API URL:" line
- "Response body as text:" line (should be JSON)
- "Step 8: ENTERING SUCCESS HANDLER" line

**The fix is live. Test it!** ✅

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **Modal Header Text**

```tsx
<p className="text-pink-100 text-sm font-medium mt-0.5">by {service.vendorName}</p>
```

**After**: 
```tsx
<p className="text-pink-100 text-sm font-medium mt-0.5">with {service.vendorName}</p>
```

```

**After**: 
```tsx

### 3. **Default Vendor Name Fallback**

```

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The terminology changes reflect a more **professional, elegant, and customer-centric** approach:

### Language Improvements:
- ✅ **"with"** instead of "by" - More collaborative
- ✅ **"The service provider"** instead of "Our vendor" - More professional
- ✅ **"Service Provider"** instead of "Wedding Vendor" - More elegant
- ✅ Consistent throughout the modal experience

### User Experience Benefits:
1. **More Sophisticated**: "Service provider" sounds more professional than "vendor"
2. **Partnership Focus**: "with" implies collaboration, not just a transaction
3. **Neutral Tone**: "The" instead of "Our" maintains professional distance
4. **Wedding Industry Standard**: Aligns with industry best practices

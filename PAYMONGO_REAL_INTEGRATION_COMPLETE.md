# üéØ PayMongo REAL Integration - Implementation Complete

## ‚úÖ What Was Just Implemented

### Backend Implementation (REAL PayMongo API)

#### New Endpoints Added:
```javascript
POST /api/payment/health                 // Health check with API key status
POST /api/payment/create-intent          // Create PayMongo payment intent
POST /api/payment/create-payment-method  // Create payment method (card)
POST /api/payment/attach-intent          // Attach payment method to intent
GET  /api/payment/payment-intent/:id     // Get payment intent status
POST /api/payment/process                // Process payment + create receipt
```

#### Real PayMongo Flow:
1. **Create Payment Intent** ‚Üí PayMongo generates intent ID
2. **Create Payment Method** ‚Üí Securely tokenize card details
3. **Attach Payment Method** ‚Üí Link card to intent and process
4. **Create Receipt** ‚Üí Generate receipt in database
5. **Update Booking** ‚Üí Update booking status to paid

### Frontend Implementation (REAL PayMongo API Calls)

#### Updated Files:
- `src/shared/services/payment/paymongoService.ts` - Now makes REAL API calls
- `src/shared/types/payment.ts` - Added receipt fields to PaymentResult
- `backend-deploy/routes/payments.cjs` - Added 3 new endpoints

#### Real Payment Flow:
```typescript
createCardPayment() {
  // Step 1: Create PayMongo Payment Intent
  POST /api/payment/create-intent
  
  // Step 2: Create PayMongo Payment Method (card tokenization)
  POST /api/payment/create-payment-method
  
  // Step 3: Attach Payment Method to Intent (process payment)
  POST /api/payment/attach-intent
  
  // Step 4: Create Receipt in Backend
  POST /api/payment/process
}
```

## üöÄ How to Test NOW

### Step 1: Add Your PayMongo Test Keys (2 minutes)

Get keys from: https://dashboard.paymongo.com/developers/api-keys

Add to `.env`:
```bash
PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_[REDACTED]_key_here
PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_[REDACTED]_key_here
VITE_PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_[REDACTED]_key_here
VITE_PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_[REDACTED]_key_here
```

### Step 2: Restart Backend (1 minute)

```powershell
cd backend-deploy
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
üí≥ [PAYMENT SERVICE] Secret Key: ‚úÖ Available
üí≥ [PAYMENT SERVICE] Public Key: ‚úÖ Available
```

### Step 3: Test Payment Health (30 seconds)

```powershell
curl http://localhost:3001/api/payment/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "paymongo_configured": true,
  "test_mode": true,
  "endpoints": [
    "POST /api/payment/create-source",
    "POST /api/payment/create-intent",
    "POST /api/payment/process",
    "POST /api/payment/webhook",
    "GET /api/payment/health"
  ]
}
```

### Step 4: Test Real Payment (2 minutes)

1. Start frontend: `npm run dev`
2. Open: http://localhost:5173
3. Go to: Individual Dashboard ‚Üí My Bookings
4. Click "Pay Deposit" on any booking
5. Enter test card:
   ```
   Card: 4343 4343 4343 4343
   Expiry: 12/34
   CVC: 123
   Name: Test User
   ```
6. Click "Pay Now"
7. Watch console logs for REAL PayMongo API calls!

## üîç What to Watch in Console

### Frontend Console (Browser DevTools F12):
```javascript
üí≥ [CARD PAYMENT - REAL] Processing REAL card payment with PayMongo...
üí≥ [STEP 1] Creating PayMongo payment intent...
‚úÖ [STEP 1] Payment intent created: pi_123abc...

üßæ [CARD PAYMENT - REAL] Receipt created: WB-2025-0001
```

### Backend Console (Terminal):
```javascript

‚úÖ [RECEIPT] Receipt created: WB-2025-0001

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Simulation vs. Real API

### ‚ùå BEFORE (Simulation):
```typescript
// Old code - NO REAL API CALLS
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1500)); // Fake delay
const paymentReference = `card_${Date.now()}`; // Fake ID
// No PayMongo API calls made!
```

### ‚úÖ NOW (Real API):
```typescript
// New code - REAL PayMongo API
const intentResponse = await fetch('/api/payment/create-intent', {...}); // REAL
const paymentMethodResponse = await fetch('/api/payment/create-payment-method', {...}); // REAL
const attachResponse = await fetch('/api/payment/attach-intent', {...}); // REAL
// Actually charges the card via PayMongo!
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

Copy this and test each item:

```markdown
## Real PayMongo Integration Testing

### Backend Setup
- [ ] Added PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY to .env
- [ ] Added PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY to .env
- [ ] Keys start with sk_test_ and pk_test_
- [ ] Restarted backend server
- [ ] Health check returns: paymongo_configured: true

### Real API Endpoint Tests
- [ ] POST /api/payment/health returns 200
- [ ] POST /api/payment/create-intent creates intent
- [ ] POST /api/payment/create-payment-method tokenizes card
- [ ] POST /api/payment/attach-intent processes payment
- [ ] POST /api/payment/process creates receipt

### Frontend Payment Test
- [ ] Payment modal opens
- [ ] Enter test card: 4343 4343 4343 4343
- [ ] Console shows "REAL" in logs (not simulation)
- [ ] Console shows 4 steps completing
- [ ] PayMongo intent ID visible in logs (pi_...)
- [ ] Payment succeeds with real transaction ID
- [ ] Receipt created in database
- [ ] Booking status updates

### Database Verification
- [ ] Receipt created in receipts table
- [ ] Payment record in payments table (if exists)
- [ ] Booking status updated to deposit_paid/fully_paid
- [ ] Receipt has paymongo_payment_id field populated

### Error Handling
- [ ] Declined card (4571 7360 0000 0008) shows proper error
- [ ] Invalid card format shows validation error
- [ ] Network error handled gracefully
- [ ] Can retry failed payment

### Console Log Verification
- [ ] Frontend logs show "CARD PAYMENT - REAL"
- [ ] Backend logs show PayMongo API calls
- [ ] All 4 steps complete successfully
- [ ] Receipt number displayed in success message
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting Real API Integration

### Problem: "PayMongo secret key not configured"

**Cause:** Environment variables not loaded

**Solution:**
```powershell
# 1. Check if keys are in .env
cat .env | Select-String "PAYMONGO"

# 2. Ensure keys start with sk_test_ and pk_test_
# WRONG: PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
# RIGHT: PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_[REDACTED]...

# 3. Restart backend
cd backend-deploy
npm run dev
```

### Problem: "PayMongo API error: Invalid card"

**Cause:** Card details not properly formatted

**Solution:**
- Remove spaces from card number: `4343434343434343`
- Ensure expiry is MM/YY format: `12/34`
- CVC must be 3 digits: `123`
- Try alternate success card: `4120000000000007`

### Problem: Payment succeeds but no receipt

**Cause:** Receipt endpoint failed after payment

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Check backend logs for receipt creation errors
üßæ [RECEIPT] Creating deposit receipt for booking: 123
‚ùå [RECEIPT] Error: ... // Look for this error

// Common causes:
// - Database connection issue
// - Missing booking data
// - Receipt generator error
```

### Problem: Console shows simulation instead of real API

**Cause:** Frontend code not updated

**Solution:**
```powershell
# 1. Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
# 2. Restart frontend
npm run dev

# 3. Check console for "REAL" keyword
# Should see: "üí≥ [CARD PAYMENT - REAL]"
# NOT: "üí≥ [CARD PAYMENT] Processing card payment..."
```

## üìä Success Indicators

### ‚úÖ You Know It's REAL PayMongo When:

1. **Console Logs Say "REAL"**
   ```
   üí≥ [CARD PAYMENT - REAL] Processing REAL card payment...
   ```

2. **You See PayMongo IDs**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Payment intent created: pi_1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I  // Starts with pi_
   ‚úÖ Payment method created: pm_9I8H7G6F5E4D3C2B1A  // Starts with pm_
   ```

3. **Backend Logs Show PayMongo API**
   ```
   üí≥ [CREATE-INTENT] PayMongo API response status: 200
   üí≥ [CREATE-PAYMENT-METHOD] PayMongo API response status: 200
   üí≥ [ATTACH-INTENT] PayMongo API response status: 200
   ```

4. **Payment Takes 3-5 Seconds** (Real API network calls)
   - Not instant like simulation
   - Shows actual processing time

5. **Receipt Has Real Transaction ID**
   ```sql
   SELECT paymongo_payment_id FROM receipts 
   WHERE id = 'latest_receipt';
   -- Result: pi_1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I (real PayMongo ID)
   ```

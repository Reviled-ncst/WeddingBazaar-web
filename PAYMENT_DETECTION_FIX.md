# 🎯 PAYMENT DETECTION FIX DEPLOYED

## ✅ ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED

### 🐛 Root Cause
The backend was checking for `payment_reference` field, but the frontend was sending the payment data under different field names:
- `transactionId: "pi_BvhbGSrU8QkkoTiiDGX6qeHQ"`
- `sourceId: "pi_BvhbGSrU8QkkoTiiDGX6qeHQ"`
- `paymentIntent.id: "pi_BvhbGSrU8QkkoTiiDGX6qeHQ"`
- `payment.id: "pi_BvhbGSrU8QkkoTiiDGX6qeHQ"`

The backend wasn't recognizing these fields, so it thought no payment was completed and tried to process payment again → **402 error**.

### 💡 Solution
Updated backend to check for **all possible payment field names**:

```javascript
const paymentAlreadyProcessed = payment_method_details?.transactionId || 
                                payment_method_details?.sourceId ||
                                payment_method_details?.paymentIntent?.id ||
                                payment_method_details?.payment?.id;
```

Now the backend will detect the payment from any of these fields and skip re-processing.

## 🔧 CODE CHANGE

**File:** `backend-deploy/routes/subscriptions/payment.cjs`

**Before:**
```javascript
const paymentAlreadyProcessed = payment_method_details?.payment_reference;

if (paymentAlreadyProcessed) {
  console.log(`✅ Payment already processed`);
  payment_intent_id = payment_method_details.payment_reference;
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
const paymentAlreadyProcessed = payment_method_details?.transactionId || 
                                payment_method_details?.sourceId ||
                                payment_method_details?.paymentIntent?.id ||
                                payment_method_details?.payment?.id;

if (paymentAlreadyProcessed) {
  console.log(`✅ Payment already processed:`, paymentAlreadyProcessed);
  console.log(`💳 Payment details:`, {
    transactionId: payment_method_details?.transactionId,
    sourceId: payment_method_details?.sourceId,
    paymentIntentId: payment_method_details?.paymentIntent?.id,
    paymentId: payment_method_details?.payment?.id
  });
  payment_intent_id = paymentAlreadyProcessed;
}
```

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT

**Git Commit:** `c047326`
**Message:** "FIX: Detect pre-paid upgrades from multiple payment field names"

**Render Deployment:**
- Auto-deploy triggered from main branch
- Estimated deploy time: 60-90 seconds
- Check status: https://dashboard.render.com

---

## 🧪 WHAT TO TEST

### After Backend Deploys (Wait ~90 seconds)

1. **Verify Backend Deployed:**
   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/health" -UseBasicParsing
   ```
   - Check `uptime` is low (< 60 seconds = new deploy)

2. **Test Pro Plan Upgrade:**
   - Go to: https://weddingbazaar-web.web.app
   - Login as vendor
   - Click "Upgrade to Pro"
   - Complete payment
   - **Check console for:** `Response status: 200` ✅

3. **Expected Backend Logs (Render):**
   ```
   ✅ Payment already processed by frontend, using reference: pi_xxx
   💳 Payment details from frontend: { transactionId: 'pi_xxx', ... }
   ✅ Subscription upgraded successfully
   ```

---

## 📊 FRONTEND PAYLOAD (For Reference)

The frontend is sending this payload to `/api/subscriptions/payment/upgrade`:

```json
{
  "vendor_id": "ac8df757-0a1a-4e99-ac41-159743730569",
  "new_plan": "pro",
  "payment_method_details": {
    "payment_method": "paymongo",
    "amount": 15,
    "currency": "PHP",
    "transactionId": "pi_BvhbGSrU8QkkoTiiDGX6qeHQ",  ← NOW DETECTED ✅
    "sourceId": "pi_BvhbGSrU8QkkoTiiDGX6qeHQ",       ← NOW DETECTED ✅
    "payment": {
      "id": "pi_BvhbGSrU8QkkoTiiDGX6qeHQ",          ← NOW DETECTED ✅
      "status": "succeeded"
    },
    "paymentIntent": {
      "id": "pi_BvhbGSrU8QkkoTiiDGX6qeHQ",          ← NOW DETECTED ✅
      "status": "succeeded"
    },
    "status": "succeeded"
  }
}
```

Backend now checks **all 4 payment ID fields** to detect pre-paid upgrades.

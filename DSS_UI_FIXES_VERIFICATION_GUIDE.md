## 🐛 Common Issues to Watch For

### ❌ If slider looks weird:
- Clear browser cache
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

### ❌ If scroll doesn't go to top:
- Make sure you click "Next" (not "Back")
- Wait for animation to complete
- Check if browser has scroll behavior disabled

### ❌ If cards are still expanding weirdly:
- Clear cache and hard refresh
- Make sure you're on Step 5 (Must-Have Services)
- Try different services

### ❌ If cultural prefs allow multiple:
- You might be in a different section (Dietary/Accessibility allow multiple)
- Look for "Select one" in the label
- Only cultural/religious should be single-select

### ❌ If textarea auto-scrolls:
- Make sure you're clicking IN the textarea, not near it
- Clear cache and refresh
- Try different browser

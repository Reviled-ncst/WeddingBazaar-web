# Location Display Issue Fixed ✅

## Problem
Bookings were showing "Los Angeles, CA" as the location instead of the actual location selected in the leaflet map during booking creation.

## Root Cause Analysis
**API Data**: The backend correctly stores the location data:
```json
{
  "event_location": "Heritage Spring Homes, Purok 1, Silang, Cavite, Calabarzon, 41188, Philippines",
  "venue_details": "asdasdads"
}
```

**Frontend Issue**: The location mapping was using incorrect field precedence:
```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
eventLocation: booking.location || booking.event_location || booking.venue_address || booking.location_name || booking.address || 'Location TBD'

// AFTER (correct)
eventLocation: booking.event_location || booking.venue_details || 'Location TBD'
```

## Fix Applied
**File**: `src/pages/users/individual/bookings/IndividualBookings_Fixed.tsx`

**Changes**:
1. **Primary Location Field**: Now uses `booking.event_location` as primary source (contains the full address selected from leaflet map)
2. **Secondary Field**: Falls back to `booking.venue_details` if event_location is empty
3. **Removed Wrong Fields**: Removed references to non-existent fields like `booking.location`, `booking.venue_address`, etc.

## Result
✅ **Correct Location Display**: Shows the actual location selected during booking: "Heritage Spring Homes, Purok 1, Silang, Cavite, Calabarzon, 41188, Philippines"
✅ **No More Generic "Los Angeles"**: Eliminated default/fallback generic location
✅ **Leaflet Map Data Preserved**: The location you selected in the map during booking creation is now properly displayed

## Technical Details
**API Field Used**: `event_location` - This field contains the full address string from the leaflet map selection
**Backup Field**: `venue_details` - Contains additional venue information if provided
**Display Location**: Table "Event Details" column now shows the correct address

The location display now accurately reflects the actual location you selected when creating the booking request!

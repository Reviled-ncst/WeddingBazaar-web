# 🎉 PUBLIC SERVICE SHARE URLs - COMPLETE & DEPLOYED

## ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED & DEPLOYED

### Security Issue Resolved
**Problem**: Internal service and vendor IDs were exposed in public share URLs
- ❌ Old: `https://weddingbazaar-web.web.app/service/SRV-0001`
- ❌ Exposed: Service ID (SRV-0001) and Vendor ID (2-2025-001)

**Solution**: Slug-based URLs with hidden IDs
- ✅ New: `https://weddingbazaar-web.web.app/service/test-wedding-photography-by-test-wedding-services?id=SRV-0001`
- ✅ SEO-friendly, human-readable, professional appearance
- ✅ IDs hidden in query parameters (not visible when sharing)

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STATUS

### Frontend - ✅ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION
- **Platform**: Firebase Hosting
- **URL**: https://weddingbazaarph.web.app
- **Status**: Live and operational
- **Build**: Successful (2.5 MB bundle, gzipped to 610 KB)
- **Deploy Time**: Just now
- **Files Updated**: 6 files (slug generator, ServicePreview, Services pages)

### Backend - ✅ NO CHANGES NEEDED
- **Platform**: Render.com
- **URL**: https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com

```

### 2. Service Preview Component
**`src/pages/shared/service-preview/ServicePreview.tsx`**
```typescript
✅ Added useSearchParams hook

### Step 1: Run Migration Script
```bash
# Connect to your database
psql $DATABASE_URL

# Run the migration
\i backend-deploy/migrations/001_create_verification_tables.sql

\dt verification_audit_log
\d users  # Check new columns were added
```

### Step 2: Verify Migration
```sql
-- Check user_verifications table
SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'user_verifications';

-- Check new columns in users table
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'users' 
AND column_name IN ('face_verified', 'document_verified', 'is_verified', 'verification_level');
```

    "reason":"Document unclear",
    "notes":"Please resubmit with better quality"
  }'
```

### 3. Database Testing

#### Verify Data Integrity
```sql
-- Check verification records
SELECT 
  v.id,
  v.user_id,
  u.email,
  v.document_type,
  v.status,
  v.submitted_at,
  v.reviewed_at
FROM user_verifications v
JOIN users u ON v.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY v.submitted_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check audit trail
SELECT 
  a.action,
  a.performed_by,
  a.old_status,
  a.new_status,
  a.notes,
  a.created_at
FROM verification_audit_log a
WHERE a.verification_id = 'verification-id-123'
ORDER BY a.created_at DESC;

-- Check user verification levels
SELECT 
  id,
  email,
  face_verified,
  document_verified,
  is_verified,
  verification_level
FROM users
WHERE is_verified = true;
```

### 4. Email Testing

#### Development Mode
Emails log to console:
```bash
# Check backend logs
tail -f backend-deploy/logs/verification.log

# Look for:
üìß [Email Service] Would send email:
   To: user@example.com
   Subject: ‚úÖ Your Wedding Bazaar Account Has Been Verified
```

#### Production Mode
Set up real email service:
1. Configure Gmail/SendGrid credentials
2. Test email delivery
3. Check spam folders
4. Verify email formatting

## üìä MONITORING & MAINTENANCE

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Verification Statistics**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM verification_statistics;
   ```

2. **Pending Verification Queue**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) as pending_count,
          AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - submitted_at))/3600) as avg_wait_hours
   FROM user_verifications
   WHERE status = 'pending';
   ```

3. **Approval Rate**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     status,
     COUNT(*) as count,
     ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) as percentage
   FROM user_verifications
   WHERE status IN ('approved', 'rejected')
   GROUP BY status;
   ```

4. **Email Delivery Success**
   - Monitor backend logs for email failures
   - Check bounce rates in email service dashboard

### Daily Admin Tasks

1. **Review Pending Verifications**
   - Target: Review within 24 hours
   - Check queue: `/admin/verifications`

2. **Handle Rejections**
   - Provide clear rejection reasons
   - Monitor resubmission rate

3. **Check Audit Logs**
   - Verify all actions are logged
   - Investigate any suspicious activity

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Authentication required" Error
```
Problem: User can't upload documents
Solution: 
- Check JWT token is being sent
- Verify token hasn't expired
- Check Authorization header format: "Bearer <token>"
```

#### 2. Database Connection Failed
```
Problem: Backend can't connect to database
Solution:
- Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Check Neon database is running
- Test connection with: psql $DATABASE_URL
```

#### 3. OCR Not Working
```
Problem: Document text not being extracted
Solution:
- Verify tesseract.js is loaded
- Check image quality (min 300x300px)
- Ensure image is clear and not blurry
- Try different document orientation
```

#### 4. Emails Not Sending
```
Problem: Users not receiving verification emails
Solution:
- Check EMAIL_SERVICE credentials
- Verify EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASSWORD
- Check spam/junk folders
- Monitor backend logs for email errors
```

#### 5. Admin Can't Approve Verifications
```
Problem: Approve button doesn't work
Solution:
- Verify user has admin role in database
- Check admin JWT token is valid
- Verify requireAdmin middleware is working
- Check browser console for errors
```

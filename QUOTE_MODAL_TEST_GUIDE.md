## 📱 Test on Multiple Devices

- ✅ Desktop browser
- ✅ Mobile browser
- ✅ Tablet

## 🐛 Known Behaviors

### If Itemized Bill Doesn't Show
This is normal if:
- Booking doesn't have `vendor_notes` with serviceItems
- Backend hasn't populated itemization data
- Old bookings from before itemization feature

**Expected**: Modal still shows summary and total

### If Location Doesn't Show
This is normal if:
- User didn't specify event location
- Field is optional

**Expected**: Location section simply won't appear

## 📊 Data Requirements

For full itemized bill to display, backend must return:
```json
{
  "vendor_notes": {
    "serviceItems": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Service Name",
        "description": "Optional",
        "quantity": 1,
        "unitPrice": 35000,
        "total": 35000
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 🎉 Success!

If you see the itemized bill with proper formatting, the enhancement is working correctly!

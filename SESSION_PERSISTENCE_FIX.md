# Session Persistence Fix - Vendor Logout on Refresh

## 🐛 Issue Identified
**Problem**: Vendor users are being logged out when refreshing the page  
**Impact**: Users have to log in again after every page refresh  
**User Affected**: All Firebase-authenticated users (vendors & couples)  

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

Firebase authentication was not explicitly setting persistence mode. While Firebase defaults to `LOCAL` persistence, something was causing the session to be lost on refresh.

### What Was Missing
```typescript
// Firebase config was missing persistence setup
auth = getAuth(app);
// ❌ No persistence configuration
```

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Added Explicit Persistence Configuration
**File**: `src/config/firebase.ts`

**Changes**:
```typescript
import { getAuth, setPersistence, browserLocalPersistence } from 'firebase/auth';

// Set persistence explicitly
if (auth) {
  await setPersistence(auth, browserLocalPersistence);
  console.log('✅ Firebase auth persistence set to LOCAL');
}
```

### 2. What This Does
- **`browserLocalPersistence`**: Session persists across browser tabs and page refreshes
- Stores authentication state in `localStorage`
- User stays logged in until they explicitly logout
- Survives browser restart (unless user clears cache)

---

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Before Fix ❌
```
1. User logs in as vendor
   ↓
2. User navigates around site (works fine)
   ↓
3. User refreshes page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
   ↓
4. ❌ User logged out, must login again
```

### After Fix ✅
```
1. User logs in as vendor
   ↓
2. User navigates around site (works fine)
   ↓
3. User refreshes page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
   ↓
4. ✅ User stays logged in, dashboard loads immediately
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Clear Browser Storage
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application → Storage
3. Click "Clear site data"
4. Close DevTools

### Step 2: Fresh Login
1. Visit: https://weddingbazaarph.web.app
2. Click "Login"
3. Enter vendor credentials
4. Should redirect to `/vendor` dashboard

### Step 3: Test Persistence
1. **Refresh the page** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
2. **Expected**: Still logged in, dashboard loads
3. **NOT Expected**: Login modal appears again

### Step 4: Test Navigation
1. Navigate to different vendor pages
2. Refresh on any page
3. Should stay logged in on all pages

### Step 5: Test Logout
1. Click logout button
2. Should return to homepage
3. Refresh - should still be logged out (correct)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Firebase Persistence Modes

1. **`browserLocalPersistence`** (✅ What we use now)
   - Persists across tabs and restarts
   - Stored in localStorage
   - Cleared only on explicit logout or cache clear

2. **`browserSessionPersistence`** (Not used)
   - Persists only in current tab
   - Lost when tab closes
   - Not suitable for our use case

3. **`inMemoryPersistence`** (Not used)
   - Only lasts while page is open
   - Lost on refresh
   - Not suitable for our use case

### Where Session Is Stored

```javascript
// After login, Firebase stores in localStorage:
localStorage.getItem('firebase:authUser:...')
// This contains encrypted auth token

// Our backend also stores:
localStorage.getItem('jwt_token')
localStorage.getItem('backend_user')
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] Vendor can log in successfully
- [ ] Vendor can refresh page and stay logged in
- [ ] Vendor can navigate between pages
- [ ] Vendor can close and reopen browser (session persists)
- [ ] Vendor can explicitly logout
- [ ] After logout, refresh keeps user logged out

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **`src/config/firebase.ts`**
   - Added `setPersistence` import
   - Added `browserLocalPersistence` import
   - Added persistence setup in Firebase initialization
   - Added success/error logging

## 🚀 Deployment Status

- ✅ Code changes committed
- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ⏳ Deploying to Firebase Hosting...
- ⏳ Waiting for deployment confirmation

## 🔄 Persistence Flow

### Login Flow
```
1. User enters credentials
   ↓
2. Firebase authenticates
   ↓
3. setPersistence ensures session saved
   ↓
4. Auth token stored in localStorage
   ↓
5. User object set in React state
   ↓
6. ✅ User logged in and session persistent
```

### Refresh Flow
```
1. Page refreshes
   ↓
2. Firebase checks localStorage for auth token
   ↓
3. Token found and valid
   ↓
4. onAuthStateChanged fires with user
   ↓
5. User automatically logged back in
   ↓
6. ✅ No login required!
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Session Security
- Auth tokens are encrypted by Firebase
- Tokens expire after a period of inactivity
- Users must re-login if token expires (security feature)
- Logging out clears all session data

### Browser Cache
- Clearing browser cache = logout
- Incognito mode = no persistence
- Different browsers = separate sessions

### Debugging
New console message will appear:
```javascript
✅ Firebase auth persistence set to LOCAL - session will persist across refreshes
```

Or if it fails:
```javascript
❌ Failed to set Firebase auth persistence: [error]
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Session Still Doesn't Persist

1. **Check Console for Persistence Message**
   ```javascript
   // Should see:
   ✅ Firebase auth persistence set to LOCAL
   ```

2. **Check localStorage**
   - Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - Should see `firebase:authUser:...` key
   - If missing, persistence setup failed

3. **Browser Compatibility**
   - localStorage must be enabled
   - Some browser extensions block localStorage
   - Try in incognito mode first

4. **Clear Cache Completely**
   - Old auth tokens might conflict
   - Clear everything and test fresh

**Status**: 🟡 DEPLOYING  
**ETA**: ~2 minutes  
**Next Step**: Test vendor login + refresh after deployment

---

**After deployment completes**:
1. Hard refresh the site (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. Login as vendor
3. Refresh the page
4. **You should stay logged in!** ✅

## Testing the Fix in Production

### Quick Test (30 seconds)

1. **Visit**: https://weddingbazaarph.web.app
2. **Navigate**: Go to any vendor page OR dashboard
3. **Click**: "Premium" button (crown icon)
4. **Expected**: UpgradePrompt modal appears
5. **Click**: "Upgrade to Pro" button (‚Ç±9/month)
6. **Expected**: ‚úÖ PayMongoPaymentModal appears immediately
7. **Verify**: Payment modal shows:
   - Title: "Pay for Pro Subscription"
   - Amount: ‚Ç±9.00
   - Payment methods: Card / E-Wallet

### Console Verification (F12 ‚Üí Console)

Expected logs in order:
```
üéØ [UpgradePrompt] handleUpgradeClick called { planName: "Pro", planPrice: 9 }
üöÄ [UpgradePrompt] Opening payment modal for Pro
üí∞ [UpgradePrompt] Amount to charge: ‚Ç±9.00 (PHP)
üìã [UpgradePrompt] Setting selectedPlan and paymentModalOpen=true
‚úÖ [UpgradePrompt] Payment modal state updated
üìä [UpgradePrompt] Payment Modal State Changed: { paymentModalOpen: true, ... }
üîç [UpgradePrompt] Checking PayMongoPaymentModal render condition: { hasSelectedPlan: true, paymentModalOpen: true }
```

### Test All Plans

| Plan | Button Text | Price | Expected Result |
|------|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| Free | "Get Started Free" | ‚Ç±0 | Direct upgrade (no modal) |
| Pro | "Upgrade to Pro" | ‚Ç±9 | ‚úÖ Payment modal appears |
| Premium | "Upgrade to Premium" | ‚Ç±19 | ‚úÖ Payment modal appears |
| Enterprise | "Upgrade to Enterprise" | ‚Ç±29 | ‚úÖ Payment modal appears |

## Technical Details

### Fix #1: requestAnimationFrame Timing
**Location**: Line 289-302

**Before**:
```typescript
setSelectedPlan(plan);
setPaymentModalOpen(true);
```

**After**:
```typescript
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  setSelectedPlan(plan);
  setPaymentModalOpen(true);
});
```

**Why**: Ensures both state updates are processed together before next render cycle, preventing race conditions where the modal render condition evaluates to false.

---

### Fix #2: Payment Modal Protection
**Location**: Line 54-66

**Before**:
```typescript
const handleClose = () => {
  hideUpgradePrompt();
  onClose();
};
```

**After**:
```typescript
const handleClose = () => {
  if (paymentModalOpen) {
    console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Payment modal is open, preventing close');
    return;
  }
  hideUpgradePrompt();
  onClose();
};
```

**Why**: Prevents UpgradePrompt from closing (via backdrop clicks or event bubbling) while user is in payment flow, ensuring uninterrupted payment process.

## 🎯 The Journey to the Perfect Slider

### Issue Evolution

1. **First Issue:** "Slider markers not aligned"
   - ✅ Fixed: Positioned markers at correct percentages

2. **Second Issue:** "Highlight doesn't match thumb"
   - ✅ Fixed: Corrected width calculation

3. **Third Issue:** "Can't slide it big movement"
   - Tried: step=5 (too sticky)
   - Tried: step=1 (too precise, barely moves)
   - ✅ **Final Solution:** step=10 with optimized dimensions

## ✅ Final Optimized Configuration

### The Goldilocks Settings (Just Right!)

```tsx
// Slider Configuration
min="20"
max="500"
step="10"           // ✅ Perfect balance - moves meaningfully but not jumpy

// Dimensions
Input height: h-12  // 48px - Easy to grab
Thumb size: 32px    // Large and visible
Track height: 16px  // Clear visual

// Visual Feedback
cursor-grab / cursor-grabbing  // Clear interaction feedback
shadow-xl                      // Enhanced visibility
scale effects on hover/active  // Professional UX
```

## 📊 Why step="10" is the Sweet Spot

### Step Size Comparison

| Step | Positions | Drag Distance | UX Result |
|------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **1** | 480 | 1px = 1 guest | ❌ Too precise, barely moves |
| **5** | 96 | 2px = 5 guests | ⚠️ Still feels sticky |
| **10** ✅ | 48 | 4px = 10 guests | ✅ **PERFECT BALANCE** |
| **20** | 24 | 8px = 20 guests | ❌ Too jumpy |

### Why step="10" Works Best

1. **Meaningful Movement**
   - Each small drag moves 10 guests
   - Visible progress with minimal effort
   - Not too slow, not too fast

2. **Practical Guest Counts**
   - Wedding planning typically rounds to 10s
   - "About 100 guests" not "97 guests"
   - Natural mental model

3. **Good Responsiveness**
   - ~4 pixels per step on typical screen
   - Easy to make both small and large adjustments
   - Smooth enough to feel natural

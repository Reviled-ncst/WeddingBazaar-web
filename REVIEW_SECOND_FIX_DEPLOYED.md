## 📋 Testing Instructions (Wait ~3 Min)

### Step 1: Verify Deployment
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/health" | Select-Object uptime
```
**Fresh deployment**: uptime < 60 seconds

### Step 2: Test Review Submission

5. **Expected**: ✅ **SUCCESS!**

### Step 3: Verify Success
**Console should show**:
```
📝 [ReviewService] Submitting review: {...}
🔑 [ReviewService] Using authentication token (length: 224)
📡 [ReviewService] Response status: 201 Created  ← SUCCESS!
📦 [ReviewService] Response data: { success: true, review: {...} }
✅ [ReviewService] Review submitted successfully!
```

**UI should show**:
- ✅ Success message

## 🎯 What's Fixed Now

### Issue 1: Auth Middleware ✅
- ❌ Was: Selecting `is_verified`, `verification_level` (don't exist)
- ✅ Now: Only selects existing columns

### Issue 2: Reviews Route ✅
- ❌ Was: Using `user_id` for bookings table
- ✅ Now: Using `couple_id` (correct column name)

---

## 🧪 Database Column Mapping

### Bookings Table Query
```sql
-- Reviews route checks booking ownership
SELECT id, couple_id, vendor_id, status 
FROM bookings 
WHERE id = ${bookingId}

-- Then compares
IF booking[0].couple_id !== userId THEN error
```

### Reviews Table Insert
```sql
-- Inserts review with user_id (reviews table column)
INSERT INTO reviews (
  booking_id, vendor_id, user_id, rating, comment
) VALUES (...)
```

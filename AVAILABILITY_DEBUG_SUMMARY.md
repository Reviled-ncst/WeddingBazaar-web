# 🔍 Availability Calendar Debug Enhancement - Summary

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Issue:** Booking availability calendar not showing dates with existing bookings as unavailable

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Database Diagnostic Script
**File:** `check-booking-dates.cjs`

**Purpose:** Verify bookings exist in database

**Results:**
```
✅ 5 bookings found for vendor 2-2025-001
   - 2025-10-27 | Status: completed
   - 2025-10-29 | Status: completed
   - 2025-10-30 | Status: downpayment
   - 2025-11-01 | Status: fully_paid
```

### 2. API Test Page
**File:** `test-availability-api.html`

**Purpose:** Test availability API endpoints in browser

**Tests:**
1. ✅ Fetch vendor bookings from API
2. ✅ Check known booked date (2025-10-29)
3. ✅ Check available date (2025-12-25)
4. ✅ Simulate frontend service logic

**Usage:**
```powershell
# Open in browser
start test-availability-api.html

# Or use Simple Browser in VS Code
```

### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging

#### File: `src/shared/components/calendar/BookingAvailabilityCalendar.tsx`

**Added logs:**
- 📅 Loading availability request details
- 🔍 Service filtering status (enabled/disabled)
- ✅ Total dates loaded
- 🔴 List of unavailable dates
- ⚠️ Warning if NO unavailable dates found

**Example output:**
```
📅 [BookingCalendar] Loading availability for: 
   { vendorId: "2-2025-001", serviceId: "SRV-0001", ... }
   
🔍 [BookingCalendar] Calling checkAvailabilityRange with:
   service filtering: ENABLED - only showing bookings for this service
   
✅ [BookingCalendar] Loaded availability for 42 dates

🔴 [BookingCalendar] Unavailable dates found:
   [
     { date: "2025-10-29", reason: "Fully booked (1 confirmed)", bookings: 1 }
   ]
```

#### File: `src/services/availabilityService.ts`

**Added logs:**
- 🔍 API request details (URL, vendor ID, date range, service filter)
- 📊 Bookings received (total, dates, statuses, service IDs)
- 📝 Sample booking data
- ❌ API error details
- 📅 Bookings grouped by date after filtering
- 🔍 Service filtering notifications

**Example output:**
```
🔍 [AvailabilityService] Fetching bookings:
   vendorId: "2-2025-001"
   bookingsUrl: "https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/bookings/vendor/2-2025-001?startDate=2025-10-20&endDate=2025-11-30"
   serviceId: "SRV-0001"
   
📊 [AvailabilityService] Received bookings:
   total: 5
   dates: ["2025-10-27", "2025-10-29", "2025-10-30", "2025-11-01", "2222-02-21"]
   statuses: ["completed", "downpayment", "fully_paid"]
   serviceIds: ["SRV-0001", "SRV-0002"]
   
🔍 [AvailabilityService] Filtering out booking for different service:
   bookingServiceId: "SRV-0002"
   requestedServiceId: "SRV-0001"
   date: "2025-10-30"
   
📅 [AvailabilityService] Bookings grouped by date:
   totalDatesWithBookings: 3
   dates: ["2025-10-27", "2025-10-29", "2025-11-01"]
   details: [
     { date: "2025-10-29", count: 1, statuses: "completed" }
   ]
```

## 🎯 Expected Diagnosis

With these logs, you can now identify the exact issue:

### Scenario 1: Service Filtering Issue ✅ MOST LIKELY
**Symptoms:**
```
🔍 service filtering: ENABLED - only showing bookings for this service
🔍 Filtering out booking for different service: SRV-0002
⚠️ NO unavailable dates found
```

**Cause:** Calendar is filtering by `serviceId`, but bookings have different service IDs

**Solution:** Don't pass `serviceId` to calendar (show ALL vendor bookings)

```tsx
<BookingAvailabilityCalendar
  vendorId={service?.vendorId}
  serviceId={undefined}  // ← CHANGE THIS
  ...
/>
```

### Scenario 2: API Not Returning Bookings
**Symptoms:**
```
📊 Received bookings: { total: 0, dates: [] }
```

**Cause:** API endpoint not working or vendor ID mismatch

**Solution:** Check API response in Network tab

### Scenario 3: Status Not Recognized
**Symptoms:**
```
📅 Bookings grouped by date: { totalDatesWithBookings: 3 }
⚠️ NO unavailable dates found
```

**Cause:** Status logic not counting bookings as "confirmed"

**Solution:** Check status filtering logic

### Scenario 4: Cache Issue
**Symptoms:**
- Old data showing after creating booking
- Dates not updating

**Cause:** Cache not cleared

**Solution:** Wait 60 seconds or clear cache manually

## 📋 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
```
F12 → Console tab
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Service
```
localhost:5173 → Services → Select any service → Click "Request Booking"
```

### Step 3: Watch Console Logs
Look for the debug messages in order:

1. ✅ `📅 [BookingCalendar] Loading availability for:` 
2. ✅ `🔍 [AvailabilityService] Fetching bookings:`
3. ✅ `📊 [AvailabilityService] Received bookings:`
4. ✅ `📅 [AvailabilityService] Bookings grouped by date:`
5. ✅ `🔴 [BookingCalendar] Unavailable dates found:` OR
   ⚠️ `⚠️ [BookingCalendar] NO unavailable dates found`

### Step 4: Identify Issue
Based on the logs, determine which scenario applies

### Step 5: Apply Fix
Follow the solution for the identified scenario

---

## 🛠️ Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Disable Service Filtering (Recommended)
**File:** `src/modules/services/components/BookingRequestModal.tsx`

```tsx
<BookingAvailabilityCalendar
  vendorId={service?.vendorId}
  serviceId={undefined}  // Show ALL vendor bookings
  selectedDate={formData.eventDate}
  onDateSelect={(date, availability) => {
    // ...existing code...
  }}
/>
```

**Rationale:** A wedding vendor can only serve ONE wedding per day, regardless of which service package the couple selects.

### Fix 2: Clear Cache After Booking
**File:** `src/modules/services/components/BookingRequestModal.tsx`

```typescript
const processBookingSubmission = async (submissionData: any) => {
  // ...existing code...
  
  if (createdBooking.success) {
    // Clear availability cache
    if (window.sessionStorage) {
      const cacheKeys = Object.keys(sessionStorage).filter(key => 
        key.includes('availability') || key.includes(service.vendorId)
      );
      cacheKeys.forEach(key => sessionStorage.removeItem(key));
    }
    
    setSuccessBookingData(createdBooking);
    setShowSuccessModal(true);
  }
};
```

### Fix 3: Add Status to Confirmed List
**File:** `src/services/availabilityService.ts`

If bookings have status `'downpayment'` or other statuses not listed:

```typescript
const confirmedBookings = dateBookings.filter((booking: any) => 
  booking.status === 'confirmed' || 
  booking.status === 'paid_in_full' || 
  booking.status === 'fully_paid' ||
  booking.status === 'completed' ||
  booking.status === 'approved' ||
  booking.status === 'downpayment_paid' ||
  booking.status === 'deposit_paid' ||
  booking.status === 'downpayment' ||  // ← ALREADY ADDED
  booking.status === 'YOUR_NEW_STATUS_HERE'
).length;
```

## 📊 Verification

After applying fixes:

1. **Clear Browser Cache:** Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Clear all
2. **Restart Dev Server:** Ctrl+C → `npm run dev`
3. **Open Service Booking Modal:** Should see logs
4. **Check Calendar:**
   - 🔴 Red dates: 2025-10-27, 10-29, 10-30, 11-01
   - 🟢 Green dates: All other future dates
5. **Click Booked Date:** Error message appears
6. **Create New Booking:** Date becomes red after submission

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Run Development Server:**
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open Service Booking Modal** and watch console logs

3. **Identify which scenario** you're experiencing

4. **Apply the corresponding fix**

5. **Test and verify** red dates appear

6. **Report results** with:
   - Screenshot of console logs
   - Screenshot of calendar (with or without red dates)
   - Copy of full console output

## 💡 Most Likely Issue

**Service Filtering is TOO STRICT** - The calendar is filtering out bookings for "SRV-0002" when viewing service "SRV-0001", but both services belong to the SAME vendor who can only serve ONE wedding per day.

**Quick Fix:**
```tsx
// In BookingRequestModal.tsx line ~1428
<BookingAvailabilityCalendar
  vendorId={service?.vendorId}
  serviceId={undefined}  // ← REMOVE SERVICE FILTERING
  selectedDate={formData.eventDate}
  onDateSelect={(date, availability) => { ... }}
/>
```

This will make ALL vendor bookings show as unavailable, regardless of which service package.

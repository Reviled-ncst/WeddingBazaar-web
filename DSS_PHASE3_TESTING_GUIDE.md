## üîß Troubleshooting

### No Packages Generated

**Possible Causes:**
1. No services in database matching criteria
2. Budget too restrictive
3. Location has no vendors
4. All must-haves unavailable

**Solution:**
- Adjust preferences (broader criteria)
- Select "Flexible" budget
- Choose multiple locations
- Reduce must-have services

### Packages Look Similar

**Explanation:**
- Limited service variety in database
- Small difference in criteria
- Normal if few vendors available

**Not a Bug:**
- Algorithm working as designed
- More vendors = more differentiation

### Match Percentages Low

**Explanation:**
- Preferences don't align with available services
- Budget or location constraints too tight
- Normal for very specific requirements

**Not a Problem:**
- Lower scores = honest matching
- Still represents best available options

## üìû Reporting Issues

**If you find a bug:**

1. **Check console** for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)
2. **Take screenshot** of results
3. **Note your preferences** (budget, location, services)
4. **Describe expected vs actual** behavior

**Not Bugs:**
- Console.log messages (intentional for testing)
- "onBookService/onMessageVendor not used" warnings
- Inline style warnings (necessary for dynamic colors)
- Zero packages if no matches exist

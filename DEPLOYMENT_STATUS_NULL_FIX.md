curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/admin/messages

# Expected: 200 OK
# {
#   "success": true,
#   "data": [ ...5 conversations... ],
#   "count": 5

## 📊 What the Fix Does

### Before (Breaking):
```sql
SELECT 
  first_name || ' ' || last_name as name  -- ❌ Returns NULL if either is NULL
FROM users
```

### After (Fixed):
```sql
SELECT 
  COALESCE(
    first_name || ' ' || last_name,  -- ✅ Try full name
    email,                            -- ✅ Fall back to email
    'Unknown User'                    -- ✅ Last resort
  ) as name
FROM users
```

### Example Results:
- User with name: `"John Doe"` → Displays `"John Doe"`
- User without name: `"vendor@test.com"` → Displays `"vendor@test.com"`
- User missing everything: → Displays `"Unknown User"`

2. **Check Render Logs**:
   - Look for SQL errors
   - Look for "Admin Messages" console logs

3. **Verify Commit**:
   ```powershell
   git log -1
   # Should show: "fix: Handle NULL user names..."
   ```

4. **Manual Trigger**:
   - Go to Render dashboard
   - Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"

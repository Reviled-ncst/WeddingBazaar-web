### Issue: "Invalid login" or "Authentication failed"

```

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify 2-Step Verification is Enabled:**
   - Required for app passwords
   - Check: https://myaccount.google.com/security

### Issue: Emails go to spam

   - Mark as "Not Spam" if it lands there

### Issue: Email sent but not received

   - Check "Sent" folder
   - Verify email was actually sent

2. **Check Spam/Junk Folder:**
   - Email may be filtered as spam
   - Mark as "Not Spam"

3. **Check Vendor Email is Correct:**
   ```sql
   -- Run in Neon SQL Editor
   SELECT u.email 
   FROM vendor_profiles vp
   JOIN users u ON vp.user_id = u.id
   WHERE vp.id = '<vendor-id>';
   ```

4. **Wait 5-10 Minutes:**
   - Gmail may delay sending
   - Check again after a few minutes

5. **Check Render Logs:**
   ```
   üìß Sending new booking notification to vendor: vendor@example.com
   ‚úÖ Vendor notification sent successfully: <message-id>

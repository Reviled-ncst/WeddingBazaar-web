# Receipt System Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Wedding Bazaar platform now has a complete receipt generation and management system that aligns with our comprehensive database schema.

## Database Schema Verification

### âœ… Schema Includes Receipts
The `booking_system_schema.sql` includes a complete `payment_receipts` table with:
- **Primary Fields**: `id`, `payment_id`, `receipt_number`, `receipt_url`
- **Customer Data**: `issued_to` (JSONB with customer info)
- **Detailed Breakdown**: `line_items` (JSONB with service, payment, and cost breakdown)
- **Financial Fields**: `total_amount`, `currency`
- **Timestamps**: `issued_date`, `created_at`

```sql
CREATE TABLE payment_receipts (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    payment_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES payments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    receipt_number VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    receipt_url TEXT,
    issued_date TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    issued_to JSONB, -- Customer details at time of payment
    line_items JSONB, -- Detailed breakdown of charges
    total_amount DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL,
    currency VARCHAR(3) DEFAULT 'PHP',
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

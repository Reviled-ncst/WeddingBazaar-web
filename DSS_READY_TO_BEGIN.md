## 🚀 HOW TO GET STARTED

### Step 1: Review the Documentation (15 minutes)

1. **Read:** `DSS_ADD_SERVICE_FORM_ENHANCEMENT.md`
   - Understand what needs to be done
   - Review the field audit results
   - Familiarize yourself with the implementation phases

2. **Open:** `DSS_IMPLEMENTATION_QUICK_START_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Review Session 1 checklist
   - Understand the testing requirements
   - Note the progress tracking format

3. **Bookmark:** `DSS_CODE_SNIPPETS_REFERENCE.md`
   - Keep this open during implementation
   - You'll copy-paste from here frequently

---

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment (5 minutes)

```powershell
# 1. Navigate to project directory
cd c:\Games\WeddingBazaar-web

# 2. Ensure dependencies are installed
npm install

# 3. Start development server
npm run dev

# 4. Open in browser
# http://localhost:5173
```

**Open in VS Code:**
```powershell
code src/pages/users/vendor/services/components/AddServiceForm.tsx
```

---

### Step 3: Backup Current File (2 minutes)

```powershell
# Create a backup of AddServiceForm.tsx
Copy-Item "src/pages/users/vendor/services/components/AddServiceForm.tsx" `
  "src/pages/users/vendor/services/components/AddServiceForm.tsx.backup"
```

---

### Step 4: Begin Implementation (Start Here!)

#### Session 1: Priority 1 Fields (2 hours)

**Goal:** Add 3 basic DSS fields to Step 1

**Files to Edit:**
- `src/pages/users/vendor/services/components/AddServiceForm.tsx`

**What to Add:**
1. Years in Business input (30 min)
2. Availability status selector (30 min)
3. Service tier toggles (1 hour)

**Reference:**
- Open `DSS_CODE_SNIPPETS_REFERENCE.md`
- Find "Snippet 1.1: Years in Business Input"
- Copy and paste into AddServiceForm.tsx after the location field
- Repeat for Snippets 1.2 and 1.3

**Testing:**
1. Save file and reload browser
2. Navigate to Vendor Dashboard → Add Service
3. Verify new fields appear
4. Test: Enter values, verify state updates
5. Submit form and check console for payload

**Commit:**
```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "feat(vendor): Add Priority 1 DSS fields (years, availability, tier)"
```

## 📞 NEED HELP?

### Common Questions:

**Q: Where do I add the code snippets?**  
A: Open `DSS_CODE_SNIPPETS_REFERENCE.md` - each snippet has a "Location" section telling you exactly where to paste.

**Q: How do I know if it's working?**  
A: Check browser console for state updates, verify form submits without errors, check network tab for API payload.

**Q: What if I break something?**  
A: You have a backup! Restore with: `Copy-Item "AddServiceForm.tsx.backup" "AddServiceForm.tsx"`

**Q: How do I test conditional fields?**  
A: Change the category dropdown to "Venue" - venue fields should appear. Change to "Photography" - they should disappear.

**Q: What about the backend?**  
A: The form state already sends these fields. You just need to verify the backend accepts them (likely already does).

# üö® CRITICAL FIX NEEDED: Service API Deployment

**Status:** ‚ùå BROKEN IN PRODUCTION  
**Impact:** HIGH - Vendors cannot add/edit services  
**Date Identified:** October 20, 2025

---

## Problem

**Error:** `API endpoint not found: POST /api/services`

**User Impact:**
- Vendors cannot create new services
- Vendors cannot edit existing services
- "Error Loading Services" message on frontend

---

## Root Cause

‚úÖ Code is correct and committed to GitHub  
‚úÖ Latest commit includes the fix (6e67701)  
‚ùå **Render has NOT deployed the latest code**

The production backend on Render is running outdated code that doesn't have the POST/PUT /api/services routes.

---

## Solution

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to Render

**Option A: Manual Deploy (RECOMMENDED)**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find: `weddingbazaar-web` service
3. Click: "Manual Deploy" button (top right)
4. Select: "Deploy latest commit"
5. Wait: ~5-10 minutes for build to complete

**Option B: Trigger with Dummy Commit**
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger: Deploy latest backend changes"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Verify Deployment

Run the diagnostic tool:
```bash
node diagnose-service-api.mjs
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üìä DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY
Health Check:        ‚úÖ PASS
GET /api/services:   ‚úÖ PASS
POST /api/services:  ‚úÖ PASS (Status: 201)
POST (minimal):      ‚úÖ PASS (Status: 201)
```

### Step 3: Test from Frontend

1. Login as vendor at https://weddingbazaar-web.web.app
2. Navigate to "Vendor Dashboard" ‚Üí "My Services"
3. Click "Add Service" button
4. Fill out form and submit
5. Verify service creation succeeds

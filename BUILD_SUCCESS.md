## üéâ BACKEND BUILD SUCCESS! 

### The Issue (RESOLVED):
Render was failing to build the backend due to TypeScript compilation errors:
```
error TS2580: Cannot find name 'process'
error TS2584: Cannot find name 'console'
```

### The Solution (APPLIED):
1. **Added `moduleResolution: "node"`** to `backend-deploy/tsconfig.json`
2. **Installed TypeScript locally** in backend-deploy directory
3. **Verified local build success** - no TypeScript errors
4. **Pushed working code to GitHub** - triggers Render auto-deployment

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Backend builds successfully locally
- ‚úÖ Backend runs and serves endpoints locally  
- ‚úÖ Code pushed to GitHub (commit 3286833)
- ‚è≥ Render auto-deployment in progress

### Expected Result:
Render should now successfully build and deploy the backend at:
**https://wedding-bazaar-backend.onrender.com**

### Test Endpoints (once deployed):
- Health: `/api/health`
- Database: `/api/test-db`
- Login: `/api/auth/login`

### Next Steps:
1. Wait for Render deployment to complete
2. Test the live backend endpoints
3. Update frontend `.env.production` with live backend URL
4. Redeploy frontend to Firebase
5. Test login functionality end-to-end

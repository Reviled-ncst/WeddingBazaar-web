## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

Improve the vendor bookings display to show **price ranges** instead of just a single total amount, providing vendors with more comprehensive pricing information at a glance.

---

## 📋 CHANGES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Enhanced Price Display Logic**

**File**: `src/pages/users/vendor/bookings/VendorBookingsSecure.tsx`

**Previous Behavior**:
- Always showed "Total Amount" as the main price display
- Estimated cost range was shown as a secondary line item above total
- Budget range was only shown in a separate contact info section

**New Behavior** (Priority Order):
1. **Show Estimated Cost Range** (if `estimatedCostMin` and `estimatedCostMax` are available)
   - Display as: "Price Range: ₱X - ₱Y"
   - Shows as "Agreed Price Range" for confirmed bookings
   - If total amount is also available, show it as "Final quoted: ₱Z"

2. **Show Budget Range** (if no estimated cost, but `budgetRange` exists)
   - Display as: "Client Budget: [range text]"
   - Clearly labeled as client's budget expectation
   - If vendor has provided a quote (totalAmount), show it as "Your quote: ₱Z"

3. **Show Single Amount** (fallback if no ranges available)
   - Display as: "Amount: ₱X" or "Agreed Amount: ₱X" (for confirmed)
   - Shows "TBD" if no amount is set

### 2. **Improved Price Breakdown Section**

**Key Improvements**:
- ✅ Price range now prominently displayed as the main price indicator
- ✅ Contextual labels based on booking status (e.g., "Agreed Price Range" vs "Price Range")
- ✅ Client budget shown separately when no estimated cost range exists
- ✅ Vendor's quote shown as secondary info when range is primary
- ✅ Deposit amount always visible when applicable
- ✅ "TBD" placeholder for pending price quotes

### 3. **Updated Budget Range Label**

**File**: `src/pages/users/vendor/bookings/VendorBookingsSecure.tsx` (line 722)

**Change**:
- Old: "Budget Range"
- New: "Client's Budget"

**Reason**: Clarifies that this is the client's budget expectation, not the vendor's quoted range.

## 🎨 UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS

### Before:
```
Price Breakdown:
├── Estimated Range: ₱50,000 - ₱75,000
├── Deposit Required: ₱25,000
└── Total Amount: ₱60,000  ← Always shown, even when range exists
```

### After (with estimated cost range):
```
Price Breakdown:
├── Deposit Required: ₱25,000
└── Price Range: ₱50,000 - ₱75,000  ← Main focus
    └── Final quoted: ₱60,000  ← Secondary info
```

### After (with budget range only):
```
Price Breakdown:
├── Deposit Required: ₱25,000
└── Client Budget: $5,000 - $10,000  ← Shows client's budget
    └── Your quote: ₱60,000  ← Vendor's quote
```

### After (no range available):
```
Price Breakdown:
├── Deposit Required: ₱25,000
└── Amount: ₱60,000  ← Falls back to single amount
```

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Data Sources (in priority order):

1. **`estimatedCostMin` & `estimatedCostMax`**
   - Source: Backend booking object
   - Used when: Both values exist and at least one is > 0
   - Display: Primary price range

2. **`budgetRange`**
   - Source: Backend booking object (text field)
   - Used when: No estimated cost range, but budgetRange is not empty
   - Display: Client's budget indicator
   - Examples: "$1,000 - $2,500", "$5,000 - $10,000"

3. **`totalAmount`**
   - Source: Backend booking object
   - Used when: No ranges available, or as secondary info with ranges
   - Display: Single quoted amount or "TBD" if zero

### Conditional Logic:

```typescript
// Priority 1: Show estimated cost range
if (estimatedCostMin > 0 || estimatedCostMax > 0) {
  Display: Price Range + Optional total amount

// Priority 2: Show budget range
} else if (budgetRange && budgetRange.trim() !== '') {
  Display: Client Budget + Optional vendor quote

// Priority 3: Show single amount
} else {
  Display: Total Amount or "TBD"
}
```

## 📊 AFFECTED AREAS

### Frontend Files Modified:
- `src/pages/users/vendor/bookings/VendorBookingsSecure.tsx` (lines 795-850)

### Backend (No Changes Required):
- Backend already returns all necessary fields
- Fields: `estimated_cost_min`, `estimated_cost_max`, `budget_range`, `total_amount`

### Database Schema:
- No changes required
- Existing bookings table already has all fields

## 📝 NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS

### Key Design Decisions:

1. **Priority Order Rationale**:
   - Estimated cost range is most specific → shown first
   - Budget range is client's expectation → shown as context
   - Single amount is least informative → fallback only

2. **Label Context**:
   - "Price Range" vs "Agreed Price Range" based on status
   - "Client Budget" clearly distinguishes from vendor's pricing
   - "Your quote" emphasizes vendor's control over pricing

3. **Fallback Handling**:
   - Always check for > 0 values to avoid showing "$0 - $0"
   - Trim empty strings for budget ranges
   - Show "TBD" instead of $0 for better UX

### Testing Scenarios:

```javascript
// Test Case 1: Full range with quote
{
  estimatedCostMin: 50000,
  estimatedCostMax: 75000,
  totalAmount: 60000,
  depositAmount: 25000
}
// Expected: Shows "Price Range" with "Final quoted" below

// Test Case 2: Budget range only
{
  budgetRange: "$5,000 - $10,000",
  totalAmount: 7500,
  depositAmount: 2500
}
// Expected: Shows "Client Budget" with "Your quote" below

// Test Case 3: Single amount only
{
  totalAmount: 50000,
  depositAmount: 20000
}
// Expected: Shows "Amount" with single value

// Test Case 4: No pricing info
{
  totalAmount: 0
}
// Expected: Shows "TBD"
```

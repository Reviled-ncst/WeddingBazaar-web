## ⚡ QUICK START

### Run Verification (15 seconds)
```bash
node verify-ratings-system.mjs
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Backend returns vendor_rating: "4.6"
✅ Backend returns vendor_review_count: 17
✅ Services display vendor-level ratings
💡 Recommendation: System is working as designed!
```

---

## 🔍 KEY FINDINGS

### What's Happening
```
Photography Service  ⭐ 4.6 (17 reviews)
Cake Service         ⭐ 4.6 (17 reviews)  ← Same rating!
```

### Why?
Both services belong to **"Perfect Weddings Co."** (vendor ID: 2-2025-001).  
The platform displays the **vendor's overall rating** on all their services.

### Is this correct?
**YES!** ✅ This matches how real wedding platforms work:
- The Knot
- WeddingWire  
- Zola

Vendors build reputation across **all** their services, not individually.

## 📊 VERIFICATION RESULTS

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Database | ✅ Working | Vendor has rating 4.6, review_count 17 |
| Backend API | ✅ Working | Returns `vendor_rating` and `vendor_review_count` |
| Frontend Mapping | ✅ Working | Reads vendor-level fields correctly |

## 🏗️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Simple Explanation
```
Vendor: "Perfect Weddings Co."
├── Rating: 4.6 ⭐ (from 17 reviews)
└── Services:
    ├── Photography    → Shows: 4.6 ⭐ (17 reviews)
    └── Cake Design    → Shows: 4.6 ⭐ (17 reviews)
```

**All services from the same vendor show the vendor's overall rating.**

### Data Flow
```
Database (vendors.rating = 4.6)
    ↓
Backend API (/api/services + vendor_rating)
    ↓
Frontend (CentralizedServiceManager.ts)
    ↓
UI (Services.tsx shows 4.6 ⭐)
```

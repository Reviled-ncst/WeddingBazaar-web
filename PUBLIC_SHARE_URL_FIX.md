# 🔓 Public Share URL Fix - No Login Required

## Date: January 2025
## Status: ✅ FIXED & DEPLOYED

---

## 🐛 Problem Identified

### Issue:
Share URLs were pointing to **protected routes** that require login:
```
❌ OLD URL (requires login):
https://weddingbazaarph.web.app/individual/services?service=SRV-0001&vendor=2-2025-001

Result: Users opening link in incognito/logged out → Redirected to login page
```

**User Experience:**
- User clicks share link in incognito mode → ❌ Redirected to login
- User shares link with friends → ❌ Friends can't view without account
- Social media sharing → ❌ Not accessible to public

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Fixed Share URLs:
Changed share URLs to use the **public service preview route**:
```
✅ NEW URL (no login required):
https://weddingbazaarph.web.app/service/SRV-0001

Result: Users can view service details without logging in ✅
```

**New User Experience:**
- User clicks share link in incognito → ✅ Service page loads
- User shares link with friends → ✅ Friends can view immediately
- Social media sharing → ✅ Publicly accessible

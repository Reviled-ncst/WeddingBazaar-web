# üö® CRITICAL FIX: Payment Balance Not Calculating

## Problem Identified

**The "Pay Balance" button shows ‚Ç±89,603.36 (full amount) instead of the remaining balance after deposit!**

### Root Causes:
1. ‚úÖ Backend code IS correct (updates `total_paid` and `remaining_balance`)
2. ‚ùå Database columns DON'T EXIST yet (`total_paid`, `remaining_balance`, etc.)
3. ‚ùå Render deployment hasn't picked up the new backend changes
4. ‚ùå Existing bookings with deposits have no calculated balance

---

## Immediate Fix Required

### Step 1: Add Database Columns (URGENT)

Run this SQL in **Neon Database SQL Editor**:

```sql
-- Add payment tracking columns
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS total_paid INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS remaining_balance INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS downpayment_amount INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS payment_progress INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_payment_date TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS payment_method VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS transaction_id VARCHAR(255);

-- Update existing bookings with deposits to calculate balances
UPDATE bookings
SET 
  total_paid = COALESCE(downpayment_amount, ROUND(COALESCE(total_amount, amount) * 0.3)),
  remaining_balance = COALESCE(total_amount, amount) - COALESCE(downpayment_amount, ROUND(COALESCE(total_amount, amount) * 0.3)),
  payment_progress = ROUND((COALESCE(downpayment_amount, ROUND(COALESCE(total_amount, amount) * 0.3))::FLOAT / NULLIF(COALESCE(total_amount, amount), 0)) * 100)
WHERE status IN ('downpayment', 'deposit_paid', 'downpayment_paid')
AND (total_paid IS NULL OR total_paid = 0);

-- Verify the update
SELECT 
  id,
  status,
  total_amount,
  amount,
  total_paid,
  remaining_balance,
  payment_progress
FROM bookings
WHERE status IN ('downpayment', 'deposit_paid', 'downpayment_paid')
LIMIT 5;
```

### Step 2: Verify Render Deployment

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Check if the deployment is complete
3. Look for commit: "fix: Payment balance updates correctly + Add full payment option"
4. If not deployed, manually trigger deployment

### Step 3: Test the Fix

After database columns are added:

1. Go to https://weddingbazaarph.web.app
2. Login as couple user
3. Go to Bookings page
4. Find booking with "Deposit Paid" status
5. Click "Pay Balance" button
6. **Expected:** Modal shows remaining balance (e.g., ‚Ç±62,722.36) NOT full amount (‚Ç±89,603.36)

## What Should Happen After Fix

### Before Fix:
```
Booking Card:
- Total Amount: ‚Ç±89,603.36
- Balance: ‚Ç±89,603.36 ‚ùå WRONG (should be reduced after deposit)

Pay Balance Modal:
- Type: Remaining Balance
- Total Amount: ‚Ç±89,603.36 ‚ùå WRONG (showing full amount)
```

### After Fix:
```
Booking Card:
- Total Amount: ‚Ç±89,603.36
- Balance: ‚Ç±62,722.36 ‚úÖ CORRECT (after ‚Ç±26,881 deposit)

Pay Balance Modal:
- Type: Remaining Balance
- Total Amount: ‚Ç±62,722.36 ‚úÖ CORRECT (only the remaining balance)
```

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Update
The `bookings` table needs these columns:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `total_paid` | INTEGER | Running total of all payments (in centavos) |
| `remaining_balance` | INTEGER | Amount left to pay (in centavos) |
| `downpayment_amount` | INTEGER | Actual deposit paid (in centavos) |
| `payment_progress` | INTEGER | Percentage complete (0-100) |
| `last_payment_date` | TIMESTAMP | When last payment was made |
| `payment_method` | VARCHAR(50) | 'card', 'gcash', 'paymaya', etc. |
| `transaction_id` | VARCHAR(255) | PayMongo transaction reference |

### Payment Flow After Fix
```
1. User pays deposit: ‚Ç±26,881
2. Backend updates:
   - total_paid = 26881 (in centavos)
   - remaining_balance = 89603 - 26881 = 62722
   - payment_progress = (26881 / 89603) * 100 = 30%
   - status = 'downpayment'

3. Frontend displays:
   - Balance: ‚Ç±62,722.36 (formatted from remaining_balance)
   - "Pay Balance" button enabled

4. User clicks "Pay Balance":
   - Modal opens with amount = 62722 (from booking.remainingBalance)
   - User pays ‚Ç±62,722.36

5. Backend updates:
   - total_paid = 26881 + 62722 = 89603
   - remaining_balance = 0
   - payment_progress = 100%
   - status = 'fully_paid'

6. Frontend displays:
   - Balance: ‚Ç±0.00
   - Status: "Fully Paid"
   - No payment buttons (already paid)
```

## Verification Queries

### Check if columns exist:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'bookings' 
AND column_name IN ('total_paid', 'remaining_balance', 'downpayment_amount', 'payment_progress')
ORDER BY column_name;
```

### Check booking with deposit:
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  service_type,
  status,
  total_amount,
  amount,
  total_paid,
  remaining_balance,
  downpayment_amount,
  payment_progress,
  last_payment_date
FROM bookings
WHERE status IN ('downpayment', 'deposit_paid', 'downpayment_paid')
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Verify payment accuracy:
```sql
SELECT 
  b.id,
  b.total_amount,
  b.total_paid,
  b.remaining_balance,
  b.payment_progress,
  SUM(r.amount_paid) as receipts_total
FROM bookings b
LEFT JOIN receipts r ON r.booking_id = b.id
WHERE b.status IN ('downpayment', 'deposit_paid', 'downpayment_paid', 'fully_paid')
GROUP BY b.id, b.total_amount, b.total_paid, b.remaining_balance, b.payment_progress
HAVING b.total_paid != COALESCE(SUM(r.amount_paid), 0);
```

## Success Criteria

After applying the fix, these should ALL be true:

- [ ] Database has all 7 payment tracking columns
- [ ] Existing bookings with deposits show correct `remaining_balance`
- [ ] Render deployment is live with new backend code
- [ ] Frontend "Pay Balance" button shows correct amount
- [ ] Payment modal displays only remaining balance, not full amount
- [ ] After paying balance, booking status updates to "Fully Paid"
- [ ] Balance shows ‚Ç±0.00 after full payment

---

## Emergency Rollback

If the fix causes issues:

### Revert Database Changes:
```sql
-- Remove the columns (NOT RECOMMENDED, will lose data)
ALTER TABLE bookings DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS total_paid;
ALTER TABLE bookings DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS remaining_balance;
-- ... etc

-- OR keep columns but reset values:
UPDATE bookings
SET 
  total_paid = 0,
  remaining_balance = NULL,
  payment_progress = 0
WHERE status IN ('downpayment', 'deposit_paid', 'downpayment_paid');
```

### Revert Backend:
```bash
git revert HEAD~2  # Revert last 2 commits
git push origin main
```

### Revert Frontend:
```bash
firebase hosting:rollback
```

## Next Steps After Fix

1. ‚úÖ Apply database schema changes (SQL above)
2. ‚úÖ Wait for Render deployment to complete
3. ‚úÖ Test payment balance calculation
4. ‚úÖ Verify full payment flow works
5. üìä Monitor payment accuracy in production
6. üìß Add email notifications for successful payments
7. üßæ Implement PDF receipt download feature

**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Requires immediate database update
**Impact:** All users with deposit-paid bookings affected
**ETA:** 10 minutes (database update + Render deployment)

**Action Required:**
1. Run SQL in Neon Database SQL Editor NOW
2. Verify Render deployment status
3. Test in production immediately after

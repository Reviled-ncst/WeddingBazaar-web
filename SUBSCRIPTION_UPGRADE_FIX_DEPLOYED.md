# 🎯 Subscription Upgrade Fix - DEPLOYED

## 🐛 Problem Identified

### Root Cause
The subscription upgrade flow had a **critical missing step**:
- ✅ Payment processing: Working correctly (PayMongo)
- ✅ `vendor_subscriptions` table: Updated with new plan
- ❌ `vendor_profiles.subscription_tier`: **NOT being updated**
- ❌ Frontend: Reads `vendor_profiles.subscription_tier` to display current plan

**Result:** Payment succeeds, backend records upgrade, but vendor's profile tier remains unchanged, so frontend shows old plan.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Backend Fix (payment.cjs)

**Added vendor_profiles update after successful subscription upgrade:**

```javascript
// After updating vendor_subscriptions table
const updatedSubResult = await sql`
  UPDATE vendor_subscriptions
  SET 
    plan_name = ${new_plan},
    status = 'active',
    updated_at = NOW()
  WHERE id = ${currentSub.id}
  RETURNING *
`;

// 🔥 CRITICAL FIX: Update vendor_profiles.subscription_tier
try {
  await sql`
    UPDATE vendor_profiles
    SET 
      subscription_tier = ${new_plan},
      updated_at = NOW()
    WHERE id = ${vendor_id}
  `;
  console.log(`✅ Vendor profile subscription_tier updated to: ${new_plan}`);
} catch (profileError) {
  console.error('⚠️ Failed to update vendor_profiles.subscription_tier:', profileError);
  // Continue anyway - subscription is upgraded in vendor_subscriptions
}
```

### Why This Works

1. **Two-Table Update:**
   - `vendor_subscriptions`: Records subscription history/billing
   - `vendor_profiles`: Frontend reads from this for current tier display

2. **Graceful Error Handling:**
   - If profile update fails, subscription still succeeds
   - Logs warning for admin intervention
   - Prevents payment from being wasted

3. **Idempotent:**
   - Can be run multiple times safely
   - Updates are atomic per table

- **Commit Message:** "fix: update vendor_profiles.subscription_tier when upgrading subscription (CRITICAL FIX)"
- **Deployment Platform:** Render
- **Auto-Deploy:** Triggered
- **URL:** https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com

### Deployment Steps Completed:
1. ✅ Identified root cause (vendor_profiles not updated)
2. ✅ Added critical vendor_profiles update logic
3. ✅ Added error handling and logging
4. ✅ Committed changes to Git
5. ✅ Pushed to GitHub main branch
6. ✅ Render auto-deploy triggered

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Pre-Flight Test (Before User Testing)
```bash
# 1. Verify Render deployment is complete
# Check: https://dashboard.render.com
# Status should be: "Live" (not "Building" or "Deploying")

# 2. Test backend health
curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/subscriptions/payment/health

# Expected Response:
# {
#   "success": true,
#   "service": "Subscription Payment Service",
#   "status": "OK",
#   ...
# }
```

### User Testing Flow
1. **Login as vendor** (existing vendor with active subscription)
2. **Navigate to Subscription page** (Vendor Dashboard → Settings → Subscription)
3. **Click "Upgrade Subscription"**
4. **Select higher plan** (e.g., Free → Basic, Basic → Professional)
5. **Complete payment** (use test card: 4343 4343 4343 4345)
6. **Verify upgrade:**
   - ✅ Payment success modal shown
   - ✅ Subscription tier badge updates immediately
   - ✅ Dashboard shows new plan features
   - ✅ No 404 error in console
   - ✅ No "Upgrade failed" message

### Database Verification (Admin Only)
```sql
-- Check both tables are updated
SELECT 
  vp.id AS vendor_id,
  vp.subscription_tier AS profile_tier,
  vs.plan_name AS subscription_plan,
  vs.status AS subscription_status,
  vs.updated_at AS subscription_updated
FROM vendor_profiles vp
LEFT JOIN vendor_subscriptions vs ON vp.id = vs.vendor_id
WHERE vp.id = '<vendor_id>'
ORDER BY vs.updated_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Both columns should match after successful upgrade
```

## 🔧 Additional Enhancements (Already Deployed)

### 1. Route Debugging Middleware
```javascript
router.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`🔍 [PAYMENT ROUTE] ${req.method} ${req.originalUrl}`);
  console.log(`🔍 [PAYMENT ROUTE] Path: ${req.path}`);
  next();
});
```

**Benefit:** Easier debugging of route matching issues

### 2. Manual Intervention Endpoint
```javascript
POST /api/subscriptions/payment/manual-intervention
```

**Purpose:** Create support tickets when payment succeeds but upgrade fails

**Payload:**
```json
{
  "vendor_id": "uuid",
  "payment_reference": "pi_xxxx",
  "issue": "payment_success_upgrade_failed",
  "requested_plan": "professional",
  "amount_paid": 50000
}
```

**Benefit:** No money lost if upgrade fails - admin can manually resolve

### 3. 404 Catch-All Route
```javascript
router.use((req, res) => {
  console.error(`❌ [PAYMENT 404] ${req.method} ${req.path} not found`);
  res.status(404).json({
    error: 'Route not found',
    availableRoutes: { ... }
  });
});
```

**Benefit:** Clear error messages for mismatched routes

## 📊 Monitoring & Logs

### Backend Logs to Watch (Render Dashboard)

**Successful Upgrade:**
```
⬆️ Upgrading subscription for vendor xxx to professional
✅ Vendor xxx validated
💰 Proration calculated: { ... }
✅ Payment already processed by frontend, using reference: pi_xxx
✅ Vendor profile subscription_tier updated to: professional
✅ Subscription upgraded successfully
```

**Failed Upgrade (with graceful handling):**
```
⬆️ Upgrading subscription for vendor xxx to professional
✅ Vendor xxx validated
💰 Proration calculated: { ... }
✅ Payment already processed by frontend
⚠️ Failed to update vendor_profiles.subscription_tier: <error>
✅ Subscription upgraded successfully (partial)
```

### Frontend Logs (Browser Console)

**Successful Flow:**
```
💳 [PAYMENT SUCCESS] { payment_id: 'pi_xxx', amount: 50000, ... }
📤 [UPGRADE API CALL] { endpoint: '/api/subscriptions/payment/upgrade', ... }
✅ Subscription upgraded successfully!
🎉 Tier updated in UI
```

**Failed Flow (Pre-Fix):**
```
💳 [PAYMENT SUCCESS] { ... }
📤 [UPGRADE API CALL] { ... }
❌ [UPGRADE API FAILED] { status: 404, error: 'Route not found' }
```

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

### Before Fix:
- Payment: ✅ Succeeds (money charged)
- `vendor_subscriptions`: ✅ Updated (plan_name = 'professional')
- `vendor_profiles.subscription_tier`: ❌ NOT updated (still 'free')
- Frontend: ❌ Shows old plan (reads from vendor_profiles)
- **Result:** Vendor pays but doesn't see upgrade

### After Fix:
- Payment: ✅ Succeeds
- `vendor_subscriptions`: ✅ Updated
- `vendor_profiles.subscription_tier`: ✅ UPDATED
- Frontend: ✅ Shows new plan
- **Result:** Vendor pays and sees upgrade immediately

---

## 🚨 Rollback Plan (If Needed)

**If critical issues arise:**

```bash
# 1. Revert Git commit
git revert 7c7f2d2
git push origin main

# 2. Render will auto-deploy previous version

# 3. Manually upgrade affected vendors:
# Run SQL in Neon database:
UPDATE vendor_profiles
SET subscription_tier = (
  SELECT plan_name FROM vendor_subscriptions
  WHERE vendor_subscriptions.vendor_id = vendor_profiles.id
  AND vendor_subscriptions.status = 'active'
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
  LIMIT 1
)
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM vendor_subscriptions
  WHERE vendor_subscriptions.vendor_id = vendor_profiles.id
  AND vendor_subscriptions.plan_name != vendor_profiles.subscription_tier
);
```

---

## 📞 Support & Manual Intervention

### For Support Team

**If vendor reports "Paid but not upgraded":**

1. **Verify payment processed:**
   - Check PayMongo dashboard for payment
   - Note payment reference (pi_xxxx)

2. **Check database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM vendor_subscriptions
   WHERE vendor_id = '<vendor_id>'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

3. **Manual fix if needed:**
   ```sql
   -- Update vendor_profiles to match subscription
   UPDATE vendor_profiles
   SET subscription_tier = 'professional'
   WHERE id = '<vendor_id>';
   ```

4. **Log intervention:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO subscription_manual_interventions (
     vendor_id,
     issue_type,
     payment_reference,
     requested_plan,
     status
   ) VALUES (
     '<vendor_id>',
     'manual_tier_sync',
     '<payment_reference>',
     'professional',
     'resolved'
   );
   ```

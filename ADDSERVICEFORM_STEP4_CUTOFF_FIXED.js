/**
 * üéØ ADDSERVICEFORM STEP 4 CUTOFF ISSUE - RESOLUTION REPORT
 * =========================================================
 * 
 * ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
 * - User was getting "cut off midway" when reaching Step 4 (Images & Tags) of AddServiceForm
 * - Form was being submitted unexpectedly or content was not fully visible
 * - Modal height and scrolling issues preventing proper interaction
 * 
 * ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED:
 * =======================
 * 
 * 1. ‚ùå MODAL HEIGHT CONSTRAINTS
 *    Problem: Modal was set to max-h-[95vh] which was too restrictive
 *    Issue: Content in Step 4 (images + tags) was taller than available space
 * 
 * 2. ‚ùå FORM SUBMISSION TRIGGERING ACCIDENTALLY
 *    Problem: Form was using <form onSubmit> wrapper with Enter key submission
 *    Issue: Pressing Enter in tag input or other fields would trigger form submit
 * 
 * 3. ‚ùå POOR SCROLLING CONTAINER STRUCTURE
 *    Problem: Flexbox container heights not properly configured for scrolling
 *    Issue: Content overflow wasn't handled correctly in multi-step modal
 * 
 * 4. ‚ùå JSX STRUCTURE ERRORS
 *    Problem: Duplicate error display sections and mismatched closing tags
 *    Issue: Build errors preventing deployment of fixes
 * 
 * 5. ‚ùå STEP 4 CONTENT TOO VERBOSE
 *    Problem: Image upload and tags sections took up too much vertical space
 *    Issue: User couldn't see all content and navigation buttons simultaneously
 * 
 * FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

 * - Added flex flex-col to main modal container for proper layout
 * - Restructured content container with flex-1 min-h-0 for proper scrolling
 * - Made footer flex-shrink-0 to keep navigation buttons always visible
 * 
 * ‚úÖ FORM SUBMISSION CONTROL:
 * --------------------------
 * - Removed <form> wrapper to prevent accidental Enter key submissions
 * - Changed form submission from onSubmit event to onClick button handler
 * - Updated handleSubmit function signature: (e?: React.MouseEvent)

 * - Changed tag input from onKeyPress to onKeyDown with stopPropagation
 * 
 * ‚úÖ CONTENT OPTIMIZATION:
 * -----------------------
 * STEP 4 CONTENT MADE MORE COMPACT:

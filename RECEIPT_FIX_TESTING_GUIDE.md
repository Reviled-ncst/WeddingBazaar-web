# 🧪 Receipt Fix Testing Guide

**Fix Deployed**: January 10, 2025 - 11:45 PM
**Commit**: `86b6bf6`
**Issue**: Manual status updates causing "Missing required fields" error

## What Was Fixed?

When you manually updated a booking status to "Paid in Full" or "Deposit Paid" through the Vendor Dashboard, the system was incorrectly trying to auto-generate a receipt. This caused errors because receipts need payment data (transaction ID, amount, payment method) that's only available during actual payment processing.

**Fix**: Manual status updates now just update the status without attempting receipt generation. Receipts are only created when customers actually pay through PayMongo.

## 🔍 How to Test the Fix

### Test 1: Manual Status Update (Should NOT Create Receipt)

1. **Open Vendor Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://weddingbazaar-web.web.app/vendor/bookings

   - Select "Paid in Full" or "Deposit Paid"
   - Click "Update Status"

4. **Expected Results** ✅
   - Status updates successfully
   - No error messages
   - NO receipt should be created (because no payment was processed)
   - Backend logs show: `ℹ️ [STATUS UPDATE] Payment status updated`

5. **Expected NO ERRORS** ❌

### Test 2: Payment Processing (SHOULD Create Receipt)

1. **Make Test Payment**
   - Go to individual user side (couple account)
   - Find a booking with unpaid status
   - Click "Pay Deposit" or "Pay Balance"

2. **Complete Payment**
   - Enter test card: `4343434343434345`
   - Expiry: any future date (e.g., `12/25`)
   - CVC: any 3 digits (e.g., `123`)
   - Click "Pay"

3. **Expected Results** ✅
   - Payment processes successfully
   - Receipt is created automatically
   - Receipt number shown (format: `WB-20250110-00001`)
   - Booking status updates to "Downpayment" or "Fully Paid"
   - "View Receipt" button appears

4. **Verify Receipt**

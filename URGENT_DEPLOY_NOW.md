# üö® URGENT: DEPLOYMENT NEEDED NOW

## Current Problem

**Receipt endpoint is returning 500 errors!**

```
üì° [BookingActions] Response status: 500
```

This confirms:
- ‚ùå Your NEW receipt generation code is **NOT deployed** to Render
- ‚ùå Backend is still running OLD version (2.6.0-PAYMENT-WORKFLOW-COMPLETE)
- ‚ùå Users clicking "View Receipt" will see errors

## Evidence

**From browser console logs:**
```javascript
üìÑ [BookingActions] Fetching receipts for booking 1761008226...
üîó [BookingActions] API URL: https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/payment/receipts/1761008226
üì° [BookingActions] Response status: 500 ‚ùå
```

**Receipt data exists in database** (`receipts.json`):
- ‚úÖ 3 receipts created
- ‚úÖ WB-20251021-00001 (latest payment)
- ‚úÖ Data is there, but endpoint is failing

## Why It's Failing

The receipt GET endpoint exists in your NEW code:
```javascript
// backend-deploy/routes/payments.cjs - NEW CODE (NOT DEPLOYED)
router.get('/receipts/:bookingId', async (req, res) => {
  // ... receipt fetching logic
});
```

But Render is still running the OLD code that doesn't have this endpoint!

## DEPLOY NOW - 3 Steps

### Step 1: Open Render Dashboard
```
https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-ct4ru8l6l47c73e31b3g
```
*(Already opened in your browser)*

### Step 2: Manual Deploy
1. You'll see your service: **weddingbazaar-web**
2. Click the **"Manual Deploy"** button (top right, blue button)
3. A dropdown will appear
4. Select: **"Deploy latest commit"**
5. Click **"Deploy"**

### Step 3: Wait & Verify (2-3 minutes)
**Watch the deployment logs:**
- Should see: Building, Pushing, Starting
- Wait for: **"Live"** status (green)

**Then test:**
```powershell
curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/health
```

Look for version change (should NOT be 2.6.0 anymore)

## After Deployment

### Test Receipt Endpoint
```powershell
# Should return receipt data (not 500 error)
curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/payment/receipts/1761008226
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "receipts": [{
    "receipt_number": "WB-20251021-00001",
    ...
  }]
}
```

### Test in Frontend
1. Go to: https://weddingbazaar-web.web.app
2. Login as couple (vendor0qw@gmail.com)
3. Go to Bookings page
4. Click **"View Receipt"** button
5. Should show receipt details (not error)

## What Will Be Deployed

**Your NEW code includes:**
1. ‚úÖ Receipt generation in `bookings.cjs` (payment processing)
2. ‚úÖ Receipt GET endpoint in `payments.cjs` (fetching receipts)
3. ‚úÖ Receipt helper functions in `receiptGenerator.cjs`
4. ‚úÖ All API keys sanitized (safe to deploy)

**Files pushed to GitHub:**
- Last commit: "chore: Remove sensitive API keys..."
- Branch: main
- Status: ‚úÖ Pushed successfully

## Troubleshooting

### "Service not found"
- Check you're logged into the correct Render account
- Service name: `weddingbazaar-web`

### "Deploy button greyed out"
- Render may already be deploying
- Check "Events" tab to see if deployment is in progress

### "Deployment failed"
- Check "Logs" tab for error messages
- Most common: Missing environment variables
- Ensure these are set:
  - PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY
  - PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY
  - DATABASE_URL
  - JWT_SECRET

### "Still getting 500 errors after deploy"
- Wait 30 seconds for Render to fully restart
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
- Clear browser cache
- Check Render logs for runtime errors

## Why Auto-Deploy Didn't Work

GitHub push protection blocked our initial push due to old secrets in git history. We:
1. ‚úÖ Removed the secrets
2. ‚úÖ Cleaned git history
3. ‚úÖ Force pushed to GitHub

But Render's auto-deploy may not have triggered because:
- Force push might not trigger webhook
- Or there's a delay in detection

**Solution: Manual deploy (guaranteed to work)**

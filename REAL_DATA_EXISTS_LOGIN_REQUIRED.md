## 🔍 Why Transaction History Was Empty

### ❌ Wrong Issue Diagnosis
I was checking for vendor ID: `a1a1a1a1-a1a1-a1a1-a1a1-a1a1a1a1a1a1`  
This was a test ID that doesn't exist in your database!

### ✅ Correct Vendor ID
Real vendor ID: `2-2025-001`  
Email: `renzrusselbauto@gmail.com`

## 📋 No Mock Data Needed!

**You asked**: "Why do you need mock data when we have this in database?"

**You're absolutely right!** 

The database already has:
- ✅ Real wallet entry
- ✅ Real transactions (3)
- ✅ Real bookings (8)
- ✅ Real receipts (18)

**The only issue**: You weren't logged in as the vendor account, so the frontend couldn't fetch the data.

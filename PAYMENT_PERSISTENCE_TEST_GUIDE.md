# 🧪 Payment Status Persistence - Testing Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed
The booking status now **persists to the database** after payment and **survives page refreshes**!

## 🎯 Quick Test (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Bookings Page
```
https://weddingbazaarph.web.app/individual/bookings
```
(Updated URL - Firebase domain changed!)

### Step 2: Make a Test Payment
1. Find a booking with status "Confirmed" or "Quote Accepted"
2. Click **"Pay Deposit"** button
3. Enter test card details:
   - Card: `4343 4343 4343 4343`
   - Expiry: `12/25` (any future date)
   - CVC: `123`
   - Name: Your name
4. Click **"Pay ₱X,XXX"**

### Step 3: Watch Console Logs
Open browser DevTools (F12) and look for:
```
✅ [CARD PAYMENT - REAL] Payment completed successfully!
📡 [BACKEND UPDATE] Updating booking status in database...
✅ [BACKEND UPDATE] Booking status updated in database
🔄 [RELOAD BOOKINGS] Fetching latest booking data...
```

### Step 4: Verify Status Changed
- ✅ Success notification appears
- ✅ Button changes from "Pay Deposit" to "Pay Balance" (or "Paid")
- ✅ Status badge updates

### Step 5: **CRITICAL TEST** - Refresh Page
Press `F5` or `Ctrl+R` to refresh the browser.

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Status REMAINS "Deposit Paid" (or "Fully Paid")
- ✅ Payment progress bar persists
- ✅ Total paid amount is correct
- ✅ Transaction details saved

**Before Fix:**
- ❌ Status would revert to "Confirmed"
- ❌ Payment info lost

## 🔍 Backend Verification

### Check Backend Logs (Optional)
Go to Render dashboard → Backend service → Logs

Look for:
```
🔄 Updating booking status: <booking-id>
✅ Booking status updated: <booking-id> -> deposit_paid
```

### Check Database (Optional)
Neon Console → Bookings Table

Query:
```sql
SELECT id, status, notes FROM bookings 
WHERE id = '<your-booking-id>';
```

Expected:
- `status`: `downpayment` (database value for deposit paid)
- `notes`: Contains payment details like:
  ```
  DEPOSIT_PAID: ₱15,000 paid via card (Transaction ID: pi_xxx)
  ```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

| Test | Expected | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Payment processes | ✅ PayMongo accepts | |
| Status updates immediately | ✅ UI shows new status | |
| Backend API called | ✅ Console shows API call | |
| Database updated | ✅ Booking status persisted | |
| **Page refresh** | ✅ **Status remains same** | ⭐ **CRITICAL** |
| Receipt generated | ✅ Receipt number created | |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Status Reverts After Refresh:
1. **Check browser console** - Look for error messages
2. **Check network tab** - Verify PATCH request succeeded
3. **Backend logs** - Confirm status update received
4. **Database** - Verify booking status changed

### Common Issues:

**Issue 1: "Failed to update booking status"**
- Backend might be sleeping (Render free tier)
- Solution: Wait 30s and try again

**Issue 2: Status shows but payment button still there**
- Frontend state vs backend mismatch
- Solution: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Issue 3: Payment succeeds but no status update**
- Backend endpoint not called
- Check console for error messages

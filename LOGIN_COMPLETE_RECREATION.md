# COMPLETE LOGIN FLOW RECREATION - FINAL FIX

## THE REAL PROBLEM (Finally Identified)

Looking at the console logs the user provided:

```
✅ [LoginModal] Error state set, modal should stay open
🔍 [LoginModal] Error value set to: Incorrect email or password...
🔄 [LoginModal] isOpen changed to: false  ← NO "🚨 onClose() called!" BEFORE THIS!
🔍 [LoginModal] Error state changed: null
```

**The smoking gun**: `isOpen` changes to `false` but there's NO `🚨 onClose() called!` log before it!

This means something is **directly calling `setIsLoginModalOpen(false)` in Header.tsx**, completely bypassing our `tracedOnClose` wrapper!

## THE ROOT CAUSE

The modal's open state is controlled by the parent (Header), but something (likely React re-render, state batching, or a hidden useEffect) is closing it after the error is set.

## THE SOLUTION

Instead of trying to trace and block all the ways the parent can close the modal, we need to **make the modal REFUSE to close** when it has an error, regardless of what the parent says.

We'll override the `isOpen` prop when there's an error.

# 🚨 DEPLOYMENT STATUS - Action Required

## Current Situation

### ✅ What's Done
- Receipt generation code added to `backend-deploy/routes/bookings.cjs`
- All sensitive API keys removed from repository
- Code successfully pushed to GitHub (after cleaning git history)

### ❌ What's NOT Done
- **Render has NOT deployed the new code yet**
- Current backend version: `2.6.0-PAYMENT-WORKFLOW-COMPLETE` (OLD)
- Receipt generation code NOT live in production

## Backend Environment Variables You Need in Render

**CONFIRMED - You need these in Render:**
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[your-neon-url]
JWT_SECRET=wedding-bazaar-production-secret-2024-firebase-integration
PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_[your-key]
PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_[your-key]
FRONTEND_URL=https://weddingbazaar-web.web.app
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
```

**NOT NEEDED in Render (frontend only):**
- VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY
- VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
- Any other VITE_* variables

## How to Deploy NOW

### Option 1: Manual Deploy (Fastest - 2 minutes)
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select service: `weddingbazaar-web`
3. Click **"Manual Deploy"** button (top right)
4. Select: **"Deploy latest commit"**
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete
6. Verify deployment below

### Option 2: Wait for Auto-Deploy (5-10 minutes)
- Render should automatically detect the GitHub push
- Check the "Events" tab in Render to see if it started
- If nothing happens after 10 min, use Option 1

## How to Verify Deployment

### Step 1: Check Backend Version
```powershell
curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/health
```

**Look for**:
- Version should change from `2.6.0-PAYMENT-WORKFLOW-COMPLETE` to a newer version
- Should show `paymongo_configured: true` (if keys are set)

### Step 2: Test Receipt Endpoint
```powershell
# This should return 404 or error (not 404 route not found)
curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/payment/receipts/test-123
```

**Expected response**: 
```json
{"success": false, "error": "No receipts found for booking test-123"}
```

**NOT expected**: `Cannot GET /api/payment/receipts/test-123`

### Step 3: Test in Frontend
1. Go to: https://weddingbazaar-web.web.app
2. Login as individual user
3. Go to Bookings page
4. Make a test payment (if possible)
5. Click "View Receipt" button
6. Should show receipt data (not "Failed to fetch receipts")

## Troubleshooting

### "Version still shows 2.6.0"
- Deployment hasn't finished yet - wait 2-3 more minutes
- OR manually trigger deploy in Render

### "paymongo_configured: false"
- Environment variables not set in Render
- Go to Render > Environment tab
- Add PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY and PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY
- Click "Save Changes" (will auto-redeploy)

### "Cannot GET /api/payment/receipts"
- Old code still deployed
- Trigger manual deploy in Render dashboard

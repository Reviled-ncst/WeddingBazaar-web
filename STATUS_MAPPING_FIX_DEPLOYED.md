# ✅ STATUS MAPPING FIX - DEPLOYED

## 🎯 Issue Found & Fixed

### Problem
After payment, the booking status badge was showing "Awaiting Quote" instead of "Deposit Paid"

### Root Cause
**Status mismatch** between backend and frontend:
- **Backend returns**: `deposit_paid`
- **Frontend expected**: `downpayment_paid`
- **Result**: Status fell through to default ("Awaiting Quote")

### Evidence from Logs
```javascript
// BEFORE payment
status: 'quote_accepted' 

// AFTER payment (backend correctly updated)
status: 'deposit_paid'  ✅
notes: 'DEPOSIT_PAID: ₱13,500 paid via card (Transaction ID: pi_gV69xLoD7HHvSQNU45ewevC8)'

// But UI mapping only had:
'downpayment_paid': { label: 'Deposit Paid', ... }
// Missing: 'deposit_paid' ❌
```

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

Added missing status mappings to handle all backend status variations:

```typescript
const statusMap = {
  // ...existing mappings...
  'downpayment_paid': { 
    label: 'Deposit Paid', 
    icon: <CreditCard />, 
    className: 'bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-700' 
  },
  'deposit_paid': {  // ✅ ADDED
    label: 'Deposit Paid', 
    icon: <CreditCard />, 
    className: 'bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-700' 
  },
  'downpayment': {  // ✅ ADDED (backend database status)
    label: 'Deposit Paid', 
    icon: <CreditCard />, 
    className: 'bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-700' 
  },
  'paid_in_full': { 
    label: 'Fully Paid', 
    icon: <Sparkles />, 
    className: 'bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-700' 
  },
  'fully_paid': {  // ✅ ADDED
    label: 'Fully Paid', 
    icon: <Sparkles />, 
    className: 'bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-700' 
  },
  // ...rest of mappings...
};
```

## 📊 Status Flow Explained

### Backend Status Values:
```
Database     →  API Response  →  Frontend Display
----------------------------------------
request      →  request       →  "Awaiting Quote"
approved     →  quote_sent    →  "Quote Received"
approved     →  quote_accepted →  "Quote Accepted"
downpayment  →  deposit_paid  →  "Deposit Paid" ✅
fully_paid   →  fully_paid    →  "Fully Paid" ✅
completed    →  completed     →  "Completed"
cancelled    →  cancelled     →  "Cancelled"
```

### Why Multiple Mappings?
Backend uses different status names in different places:
- **Database column**: `downpayment`, `fully_paid`
- **API response**: `deposit_paid`, `fully_paid`
- **Notes prefix**: `DEPOSIT_PAID`, `FULLY_PAID`

Frontend now handles ALL variations! ✅

2. Check logs from time of payment
3. Look for `[PROCESS-PAYMENT]` logs
4. Share any errors found

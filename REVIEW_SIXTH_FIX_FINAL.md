## 🔧 Latest Fix Details

### Error
```
❌ column "total_reviews" of relation "vendors" does not exist
```

### Root Cause
Vendors table has `review_count` column, but backend code was trying to update `total_reviews`.

### Solution
```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_reviews FROM reviews...
UPDATE vendors SET total_reviews = ${count}...

// AFTER (WORKING)
SELECT COUNT(*) as review_count FROM reviews...
UPDATE vendors SET review_count = ${count}...
```

## 📊 Final System Architecture

### Complete Review Flow

```
1. User clicks "Rate & Review" on completed booking
2. RatingModal opens (5-star UI)
3. User submits rating + comment
4. Frontend: reviewService.submitReview()
   ├─ Authentication: JWT token
   └─ POST /api/reviews
5. Backend: reviews.cjs
   ├─ Validate booking ownership
   ├─ Check booking is completed
   ├─ Prevent duplicate reviews
   ├─ Generate review ID (REV-{timestamp}-{random})
   ├─ Insert review into reviews table
   ├─ Calculate vendor's average rating
   └─ Update vendors.rating and vendors.review_count
6. Frontend: Success message + button disappears
7. Database: Review saved + Vendor stats updated
```

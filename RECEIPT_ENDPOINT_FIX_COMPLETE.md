# RECEIPT ENDPOINT FIX - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Date: October 21, 2025
## Status: **DEPLOYED AND VERIFIED**

---

## üêõ Problem Identified

The receipt endpoint `/api/payment/receipts/:bookingId` was failing with error:
```
‚ùå NeonDbError: column r.payment_type does not exist
‚ùå NeonDbError: column u.full_name does not exist
```

### Root Causes
1. **Column Name Mismatch**: The backend query was trying to select `u.full_name` but the `users` table has `first_name` and `last_name` columns instead.
2. **Missing Receipts**: One paid booking (ID: 1761031420) didn't have a receipt record.

---

## üîß Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Fix - Generated Missing Receipt
**Script**: `generate-missing-receipt-now.cjs`

- Created receipt for booking `1761031420` (Catering Services)
- Receipt Number: `RCP-1761031743782-289`
- Amount: ‚Ç±21,841.00 (deposit payment)
- Status: Completed ‚úÖ

### 2. Backend Code Fix
**File**: `backend-deploy/routes/payments.cjs`

**Changed:**
```sql
u.full_name as couple_name
```

**To:**
```sql
CONCAT(u.first_name, ' ', u.last_name) as couple_name
```

**Deployed**: Committed to GitHub, auto-deployed to Render ‚úÖ

## üß™ Test Endpoints

### Receipt Endpoint
```bash
GET https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/payment/receipts/1761031420
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "receipts": [
    {
      "id": "4e9bcc44-68ea-442f-922a-146b770bc81f",
      "receipt_number": "RCP-1761031743782-289",
      "booking_id": "1761031420",
      "payment_type": "deposit",
      "amount": 2184100,
      "currency": "PHP",
      "payment_method": "card",
      "total_paid": 2184100,
      "remaining_balance": 5096124,
      "couple_name": "couple test",
      "vendor_business_name": "Test Wedding Services",
      "service_name": "Catering Services"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üéØ Frontend Integration

### IndividualBookings.tsx
The "View Receipt" button should now work correctly:

```typescript
// Button click handler
const handleViewReceipt = async (booking: EnhancedBooking) => {
  console.log('üìÑ [ViewReceipt] Opening receipt modal for booking:', booking.id);
  setReceiptBooking(booking);
  setShowReceiptModal(true);
};
```

### Expected Frontend Behavior
1. User clicks "View Receipt" button on paid booking
2. Frontend calls `GET /api/payment/receipts/:bookingId`
3. Backend returns receipt array with all payment details
4. Receipt modal displays formatted receipt information
5. User can view payment history, amounts, and transaction details

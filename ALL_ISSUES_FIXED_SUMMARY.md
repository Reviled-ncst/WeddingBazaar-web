## 🔧 Issues Fixed Today

### 1. ✅ Couple User Routing Issue
**Problem:** User with `"couple"` role was routed to `/vendor` instead of `/individual`  
**Cause:** Email pattern detection (`vendor0qw@gmail.com` triggered false vendor detection)  
**Fix:** Removed email pattern checking, use only solid DB properties  
**Status:** ✅ Deployed

### 2. ✅ Public Share URL Issue
**Problem:** Share URLs required login (`/individual/services?service=...`)  
**Cause:** URLs pointed to protected routes  
**Fix:** Changed to public route (`/service/:serviceId`)  
**Status:** ✅ Deployed

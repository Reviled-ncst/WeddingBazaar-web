  new Map(
    services.map(service => [service.vendorId, {
      vendorId: service.vendorId,
      vendorName: service.vendorName,
      category: service.category
    }])
  ).values()
);
```

### **2. Dynamic Conversation Naming**
```typescript
const conversationName = categories.length === 1 
  ? `${categories[0]} Planning Discussion`
  : categories.length <= 3 
    ? `${categories.join(' & ')} Planning`
    : `Wedding Planning - ${categories.length} Categories`;
```

### **3. Real User Integration**
```typescript
const { user } = useAuth();
// ...
userId: user?.id || 'demo-user-123',
userName: (user as any)?.name || user?.email || 'Demo User',
```

## 📱 RESPONSIVE DESIGN

- Scrollable service lists with proper spacing
- Mobile-first modal design

### **Desktop Enhancement**

- **Service Context**: Group chat includes context of all services being discussed
- **Initial Message**: Automatically introduces the user and lists all services

## 🚀 INTEGRATION POINTS

2. **AuthContext**: Uses real user data for personalization
3. **MessagingAPI**: Integrates with existing messaging infrastructure

  detail: {
    serviceId: service.id,
    serviceName: service.name,
    vendorName: service.vendorName,
    status: 'quote_requested'
  }
});
window.dispatchEvent(bookingCreatedEvent);
```

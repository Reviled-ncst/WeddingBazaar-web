   - Now logs EXACT API endpoints being called
   - Shows fetch status (success/fail)
   - Visible with 🚨 emoji for easy spotting

2. **Built & Deployed Frontend**
   - Build: Successful ✅
   - Deploy: Firebase (weddingbazaarph.web.app) ✅
   - Version: Latest with enhanced logging ✅

3. **Fixed Syntax Errors**
   - Removed duplicate code from availability service
   - File now compiles correctly

## 🎯 The Question We're Answering

**Is the calendar actually calling the backend API to fetch bookings?**

Your logs showed:
```
📅 [AvailabilityService] Filtered 1 bookings for service SRV-0002 (out of 10 total)
```

This proves:
- ✅ Calendar IS getting 10 bookings
- ✅ Calendar IS filtering by service
- ❓ **BUT**: No API call visible in backend logs

Possible explanations:
1. **Cached data** - Using old data from previous fetch
2. **Silent API call** - Call happens but not logged on backend
3. **Client-side filtering** - Reusing couple's bookings instead of vendor fetch

## 🧪 Next Test Phase

### User Action Required:
1. Visit: https://weddingbazaarph.web.app
2. Hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Open booking modal on ANY service
4. Check console for these NEW logs:

```
🌐 [AvailabilityService] 🚨 FETCHING BOOKINGS FROM: <URL>
📡 [AvailabilityService] 🚨 BOOKINGS FETCH COMPLETED: <STATUS>
```

### What This Will Tell Us:
- **If you see 🚨 FETCHING**: API call is happening ✅
- **If you DON'T see 🚨 FETCHING**: Calendar not calling API ❌
- **If you see CORS error**: Backend blocking frontend ⚠️
- **If you see 404**: Endpoint doesn't exist ⚠️

## 📋 Current Understanding

### Backend Status
- **URL**: https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com
- **Status**: ✅ Live and operational
- **Version**: 2.7.0-SQL-FIX-DEPLOYED
- **Database**: ✅ Connected (10 bookings exist)

### Frontend Status
- **URL**: https://weddingbazaarph.web.app
- **Status**: ✅ Just deployed with new logging
- **Build**: ✅ Successful (2458 modules)

### Database Status
- **Vendor ID**: 2-2025-001
- **Total Bookings**: 10
- **Booking Distribution**:
  - Photography (SRV-0001): 5 bookings
  - Catering (SRV-00004): 4 bookings
  - Baker (SRV-0002): 1 booking

---

## 🔄 Service-Specific vs Vendor-Specific Confirmed

**CONFIRMED**: You want **SERVICE-SPECIFIC blocking** (Option 1) ✅

This means:
- ✅ Each service blocks only its own booked dates
- ✅ Photography blocks its 5 dates
- ✅ Catering blocks its 4 dates
- ✅ Baker blocks its 1 date
- ✅ Calendar appears in booking modal (not standalone)

**Current Implementation**: Already service-specific ✅

## 🐛 Remaining Questions to Answer

1. **Is the API actually being called when calendar loads?**
   - Answer: Will know from 🚨 logs

2. **Why don't we see the API call in backend logs?**
   - Possible: Cached locally
   - Possible: Timing issue
   - Possible: Wrong endpoint

3. **Are the red dates showing correctly?**
   - Baker: Should show Oct 21 red
   - Photography: Should show Oct 21, 22, 24, 28 red
   - Catering: Should show Oct 21, 24, 30 red

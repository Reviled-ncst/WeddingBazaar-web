## ✅ Success Indicators

### You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ Service cards have MORE information than before
- ✅ You can see vendor experience (years)
- ✅ You can see service tier (Premium/Standard/Basic)
- ✅ You can see wedding styles as colorful pills

### You'll know there's a problem if:
- ❌ Service cards look exactly the same as before
- ❌ No years of experience shown anywhere

## 📊 Expected Results

### Services with Full DSS Data:
```
Photography Services → Usually have all fields
Wedding Planning → Many specializations
Catering Services → Often Premium tier
Venue Services → Multiple wedding styles
```

### Services with Partial DSS Data:
```
Some services may have only:
- Years in business
- Service tier
- Availability

This is NORMAL and expected!
```

### Services with No DSS Data:
```
If a service has NO DSS fields:
- Card looks like before (no DSS section)
- This is RARE but acceptable
- Gracefully handled by UI
```

## 🎓 How It Works

### Payment Flow
```
1. Vendor sends quote → Booking status: 'request'
2. Couple accepts quote → Booking status: 'approved'
3. Couple clicks "Pay Deposit" OR "Pay Full Amount" ← NEW CHOICE!
4. Payment processed → Receipt created automatically
5. Booking status updates → 'downpayment' or 'fully_paid'
6. Receipt available via "Show Receipt" button
```

### Receipt Storage
```
Database Table: receipts
├── receipt_number: "WB-20250110-001" (unique)
├── booking_id: Links to booking
├── couple_id: User who paid
├── vendor_id: Vendor who received
├── amount_paid: Amount in centavos
├── payment_type: 'deposit' or 'full_payment'
├── payment_method: 'gcash', 'card', etc.
└── created_at: Timestamp
```

## üéØ Root Cause: Frontend Not Refreshing

The database IS correct! The issue is the frontend is showing **cached/stale data**.

### Solutions:

## Solution 1: Hard Refresh Browser (QUICKEST)

1. Open the bookings page
2. Press **Ctrl + Shift + R** (Windows) or **Cmd + Shift + R** (Mac)
3. This clears cache and reloads with fresh data

## Solution 2: Clear Browser Cache

1. Press **F12** (open DevTools)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

## Solution 3: Force API Reload

Add this code to force fresh data from backend:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Run this:
```javascript
// Force reload bookings from backend
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
location.reload(true);
```

## üß™ Expected Result After Hard Refresh:

### Card 1 (asdas):
```
Total Amount: ‚Ç±45,000 (fallback - no quote)
Status: Confirmed
```

### Card 2 (Baker):  
```
Total Amount: ‚Ç±45,000 (fallback - old quote format)
Status: Quote Received
```

### Card 3 (Flower): 
```
Total Amount: ‚Ç±89,603.36 ‚Üê NEW QUOTE PRICE!
Status: Quote Received
```

## üîç Verify Data is Correct

Open browser console (F12) and look for these logs:

```
üí∞ [AMOUNT PRIORITY] Checking fields: {
  quoted_price: "89603.36",  ‚Üê For Flower booking
  final_price: null,
  amount: "89603.36",
  total_amount: "0.00",
  selected: 89603.36
}
```

If you see `quoted_price: null` for the Flower booking, then the API isn't returning the updated data.

---

## üö® If Hard Refresh Doesn't Work:

### Check 1: Verify API Returns Correct Data

Open Network tab (F12) and find the bookings API call:
```
GET /api/bookings/couple/1-2025-001
```

Look for the Flower booking (ID 1761013430) in the response:
```json
{
  "id": 1761013430,
  "quoted_price": "89603.36",  ‚Üê Should be here!
  "amount": "89603.36"
}
```

If `quoted_price` is null in API response ‚Üí Backend caching issue
If `quoted_price` is present ‚Üí Frontend mapping issue

### Check 2: Console Logs

Look for mapping logs:
```
üîÑ [mapComprehensiveBookingToUI] Processing booking: 1761013430
   quoted_price: 89603.36  ‚Üê Should show the value!
```

---

## ‚úÖ MOST LIKELY: Just Need Hard Refresh

The database is correct (your JSON proves it). The frontend code is correct (we fixed the mapping). 

You just need to **force the browser to fetch fresh data** from the backend!

**Try**: Ctrl + Shift + R

---

## üìä After Fix - Expected Display:

| Service | Status | Price | Source |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| asdas | Confirmed | ‚Ç±45,000 | Fallback (no quote) |
| Baker | Quote Received | ‚Ç±45,000 | Fallback (old format) |
| Flower | Quote Received | **‚Ç±89,603.36** | quoted_price field ‚úÖ |

The Flower booking should show the exact quoted price from the database!

## üéØ Final Answer to Your Question

### Question: "why am i in premium i haven't subscribe"

### Answer:
**You're NOT in Premium anymore!** ‚úÖ

The test confirms you are correctly showing as **"Basic" (Free Tier)** with $0/month pricing. The Premium issue was caused by hardcoded mock data in the frontend, which I removed and replaced with real API calls to the backend database.

**Current Status**:
- ‚úÖ Plan: Basic (Free)
- ‚úÖ Price: $0/month
- ‚úÖ Limits: 5 services, unlimited bookings, 10 portfolio images
- ‚úÖ Source: Real database query (not mock data)

If you still see "Premium" in your browser, do a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac).

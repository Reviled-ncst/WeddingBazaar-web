# Payment Modal Fix - Testing Guide

## Quick Test Steps

### 1. Access Premium Feature
```
1. Navigate to any vendor page (e.g., Add Service Form)
2. Click "Premium" button or try to use a premium feature
3. UpgradePrompt modal should appear
```

### 2. Test Payment Modal Opens
```
1. In UpgradePrompt, you'll see three plans:
   - ✨ Free (Get Started Free)
   - 💎 Pro (Upgrade to Pro) - ₱9/month
   - 👑 Premium (Upgrade to Premium) - ₱19/month
   - 🏢 Enterprise (Upgrade to Enterprise) - ₱29/month

2. Click "Upgrade to Pro" button
3. ✅ PayMongoPaymentModal should appear
4. Modal should show:
   - Title: "Pay for Pro Subscription"
   - Amount: ₱9.00
   - Payment method tabs (Card / E-Wallet)
```

### 3. Verify Modal Behavior
```
✅ Expected Behavior:
- Payment modal appears immediately after clicking upgrade
- UpgradePrompt stays in background (slightly dimmed)
- Clicking outside payment modal does NOT close UpgradePrompt
- Can close payment modal with X button
- After closing payment modal, can close UpgradePrompt
```

### 4. Console Verification
**Open Browser DevTools (F12) → Console Tab**

You should see these logs in order:
```
🎯 [UpgradePrompt] handleUpgradeClick called { planName: "Pro", planPrice: 9, isProcessing: false }
🚀 [UpgradePrompt] Opening payment modal for Pro
💰 [UpgradePrompt] Amount to charge: ₱9.00 (PHP)
📋 [UpgradePrompt] Setting selectedPlan and paymentModalOpen=true
✅ [UpgradePrompt] Payment modal state updated
📊 [UpgradePrompt] Payment Modal State Changed: { paymentModalOpen: true, selectedPlanName: "Pro", selectedPlanPrice: 9 }
🔍 [UpgradePrompt] Checking PayMongoPaymentModal render condition: { hasSelectedPlan: true, paymentModalOpen: true }
```

## What Was Fixed

### Problem 1: State Update Timing ⏱️
**Before**: 
```typescript
setSelectedPlan(plan);      // State update 1
setPaymentModalOpen(true);  // State update 2
// React batches these, might not update in time
```

**After**:
```typescript
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  setSelectedPlan(plan);      // Both updates together
  setPaymentModalOpen(true);  // In next animation frame
});
// Ensures both states update before next render
```

### Problem 2: Premature Closing 🚪
**Before**:
```typescript
const handleClose = () => {
  hideUpgradePrompt();
  onClose();
  // Would close even if payment modal is open!
};
```

**After**:
```typescript
const handleClose = () => {
  if (paymentModalOpen) {
    console.log('⚠️ Payment modal is open, preventing close');
    return; // Don't close!
  }
  hideUpgradePrompt();
  onClose();
};
```

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Happy Path ✅
```
1. Click Premium button → UpgradePrompt opens
2. Click "Upgrade to Pro" → PayMongoPaymentModal opens
3. Enter card details → Payment processes
4. Success → Both modals close
5. ✅ User upgraded to Pro plan
```

### Scenario 2: Cancel Payment ❌
```
1. Click Premium button → UpgradePrompt opens
2. Click "Upgrade to Premium" → PayMongoPaymentModal opens
3. Click X on payment modal → Payment modal closes
4. UpgradePrompt still open (user can try again)
5. Click X on UpgradePrompt → Closes properly
```

### Scenario 3: Backdrop Click (Critical Fix) 🎯
```
1. Click Premium button → UpgradePrompt opens
2. Click "Upgrade to Enterprise" → PayMongoPaymentModal opens
3. Click on dark backdrop behind modal
4. ✅ UpgradePrompt stays open (FIXED - was closing before)
5. Payment modal still visible and functional
```

### Scenario 4: Rapid Clicking 🖱️
```
1. Click Premium button → UpgradePrompt opens
2. Rapidly click "Upgrade to Pro" 5 times
3. ✅ Only one PayMongoPaymentModal opens
4. isProcessing state prevents duplicate modals
```

## Expected Console Output

### Successful Modal Open
```javascript
// User clicks "Upgrade to Pro"
🎯 [UpgradePrompt] handleUpgradeClick called { planName: "Pro", planPrice: 9, isProcessing: false }
🚀 [UpgradePrompt] Opening payment modal for Pro
💰 [UpgradePrompt] Amount to charge: ₱9.00 (PHP)
📋 [UpgradePrompt] Setting selectedPlan and paymentModalOpen=true

// Next animation frame
✅ [UpgradePrompt] Payment modal state updated

// State change detected
📊 [UpgradePrompt] Payment Modal State Changed: {
  paymentModalOpen: true,
  selectedPlanName: "Pro",
  selectedPlanPrice: 9,
  timestamp: "2025-01-27T10:30:00.000Z"
}

// Render condition check
🔍 [UpgradePrompt] Checking PayMongoPaymentModal render condition: {
  hasSelectedPlan: true,
  paymentModalOpen: true,
  selectedPlanName: "Pro"
}

// Modal renders successfully ✅
```

### Backdrop Click (While Modal Open)
```javascript
// User clicks backdrop
🚪 [UpgradePrompt] handleClose called
⚠️ [UpgradePrompt] Payment modal is open, preventing close

// UpgradePrompt stays open ✅
```

### Close Payment Modal
```javascript
// User clicks X on payment modal
🚪 [UpgradePrompt] Payment modal onClose called

// State updates
📊 [UpgradePrompt] Payment Modal State Changed: {
  paymentModalOpen: false,
  selectedPlanName: null,
  selectedPlanPrice: undefined
}

// Now user can close UpgradePrompt
🚪 [UpgradePrompt] handleClose called
// No "preventing close" message
// UpgradePrompt closes ✅
```

## Troubleshooting

### Modal Still Not Appearing?

**Check 1: Browser Console**
```
F12 → Console Tab
Look for error messages
Check if logs appear in correct order
```

**Check 2: State Values**
```javascript
// Should see these logs:
📊 Payment Modal State Changed: { paymentModalOpen: true, ... }
🔍 Checking PayMongoPaymentModal render condition: { hasSelectedPlan: true, ... }
```

**Check 3: Network**
```
F12 → Network Tab
Ensure React hasn't crashed
Check for JavaScript errors
```

**Check 4: React DevTools**
```
Install React DevTools extension
Search for "UpgradePrompt" component
Check state: paymentModalOpen should be true
Check state: selectedPlan should have plan object
```

### Modal Opens But Closes Immediately?

**Likely Cause**: Event bubbling or backdrop click
**Solution**: Already fixed in handleClose() - check console for:
```
⚠️ [UpgradePrompt] Payment modal is open, preventing close
```

### Double Clicks Opening Multiple Modals?

**Likely Cause**: isProcessing not working
**Solution**: Already handled - check console for:
```
⚠️ [UpgradePrompt] Payment already in progress, ignoring click
```

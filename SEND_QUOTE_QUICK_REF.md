## 📊 Smart Package System

### 3 Simple Tiers:

**🥉 Essential Package** - Good for small weddings
- Base price (adjusted for guest count)
- Core features only
- Professional service

**🥈 Complete Package ⭐ MOST POPULAR**
- Mid-tier pricing (auto-adjusted)
- Full service package
- Most vendors choose this

**🥇 Premium Package** - Luxury experience
- High-end pricing
- All premium features
- VIP service

---

## 💰 Auto-Adjusted Pricing

### Factors Considered:
1. **Service Type** - Different base prices per service
2. **Guest Count** - More guests = higher price (0.8x to 1.6x)
3. **Budget Range** - Adjusts to couple's budget (0.7x to 2.0x)
4. **Special Cases** - Caterers price per-person automatically

### Example (DJ Service):
- 50 guests, ₱25k-50k budget → ₱20k / ₱35k / ₱55k
- 150 guests, ₱100k+ budget → ₱41k / ₱72k / ₱113k

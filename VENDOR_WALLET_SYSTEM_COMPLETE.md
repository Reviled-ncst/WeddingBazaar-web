### Data Flow

```
1. Couple pays for booking
   ├─▶ PayMongo processes payment
   ├─▶ Receipt created in database
   └─▶ Booking status: 'fully_paid'

2. Service delivered & confirmed
   ├─▶ Vendor marks as complete
   ├─▶ Couple marks as complete
   └─▶ Booking status: 'completed' (fully_completed = true)

3. Funds become available
   ├─▶ Wallet calculates earnings from completed bookings
   ├─▶ Amount added to available_balance
   └─▶ Vendor can request withdrawal

4. Withdrawal process
   ├─▶ Vendor submits withdrawal request
   ├─▶ Admin approves (manual process)
   ├─▶ Funds transferred via PayMongo/bank
   └─▶ Withdrawal marked as completed
```

## 💾 Database Schema

### Completed Booking Criteria

For a booking to count towards wallet earnings:
```sql
WHERE 
  b.status = 'completed'
  AND b.fully_completed = true
  AND b.vendor_completed = true
  AND b.couple_completed = true
```

### Wallet Balance Calculation

```sql
-- Total Earnings (all-time)
SELECT SUM(r.amount_paid) as total_earnings
FROM receipts r
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON r.booking_id = b.id
WHERE r.vendor_id = :vendorId
  AND b.status = 'completed'
  AND b.fully_completed = true

-- Available Balance (ready for withdrawal)
SELECT SUM(r.amount_paid) as available_balance
FROM receipts r
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON r.booking_id = b.id
WHERE r.vendor_id = :vendorId
  AND b.status = 'completed'
  AND b.fully_completed = true
  AND r.id NOT IN (SELECT receipt_id FROM withdrawals WHERE status != 'cancelled')

-- Pending Balance (paid but not confirmed)
SELECT SUM(r.amount_paid) as pending_balance
FROM receipts r
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON r.booking_id = b.id
WHERE r.vendor_id = :vendorId
  AND (b.status = 'fully_paid' OR b.status = 'paid_in_full')
  AND b.fully_completed = false
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Transactions Showing
**Cause**: Bookings not fully completed  
**Solution**: Ensure both vendor and couple have confirmed completion

### Balance Mismatch
**Cause**: Recent payment not reflected  
**Solution**: Click "Refresh" button or hard reload page

### Withdrawal Request Failed
**Cause**: Insufficient balance or invalid amount  
**Solution**: Check available balance and ensure amount is positive

### Export Not Working
**Cause**: No transactions in date range  
**Solution**: Adjust date filters or check if bookings exist

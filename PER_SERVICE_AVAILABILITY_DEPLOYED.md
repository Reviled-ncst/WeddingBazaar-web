## 🏪 **HOW IT WORKS NOW:**

### Example: Same Vendor, Multiple Services

**Vendor**: "Test Wedding Services" (ID: 2-2025-001)

**Services**:
1. **Premium Photography** (SRV-0001)
2. **Deluxe Photography** (SRV-0002)
3. **Catering Package** (SRV-00004)

**Bookings**:
- Oct 21 → Premium Photography (SRV-0001) is booked
- Oct 24 → Catering Package (SRV-00004) is booked

**Calendar Results**:

#### When Booking "Premium Photography" (SRV-0001):
```
October 2025:
21 = 🔴 RED (this service is booked)
24 = 🟢 GREEN (catering is booked, but not this service!)
```

#### When Booking "Deluxe Photography" (SRV-0002):
```
October 2025:
21 = 🟢 GREEN (Premium Photography booked, but not this service!)
24 = 🟢 GREEN (catering is booked, but not this service!)
```

#### When Booking "Catering Package" (SRV-00004):
```
October 2025:
21 = 🟢 GREEN (photography booked, but not this service!)
24 = 🔴 RED (this service is booked)
```

**Each service has independent availability!** ✅

## 📊 **VISUAL COMPARISON:**

Same vendor, 3 services, 2 bookings:

| Date | Premium Photo<br>(SRV-0001) | Deluxe Photo<br>(SRV-0002) | Catering<br>(SRV-00004) |
|------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Oct 20 | 🟢 Available | 🟢 Available | 🟢 Available |
| Oct 21 | 🔴 **Booked** | 🟢 Available | 🟢 Available |
| Oct 22 | 🟢 Available | 🟢 Available | 🟢 Available |
| Oct 23 | 🟢 Available | 🟢 Available | 🟢 Available |
| Oct 24 | 🟢 Available | 🟢 Available | 🔴 **Booked** |
| Oct 25 | 🟢 Available | 🟢 Available | 🟢 Available |

**Notice**: Each service has its own calendar! 🎯

## 🔧 **CODE CHANGES:**

### 1. Updated Calendar Component
**File**: `src/shared/components/calendar/BookingAvailabilityCalendar.tsx`

**Added**:
```typescript
interface BookingAvailabilityCalendarProps {
  vendorId?: string;
  serviceId?: string;  // NEW: Service-specific availability
  // ...existing props
}
```

**Updated Logic**:
```typescript
const availabilityMap = serviceId 
  ? await availabilityService.checkServiceAvailabilityRange(serviceId, vendorId, startStr, endStr)
  : await availabilityService.checkAvailabilityRange(vendorId, startStr, endStr);
```

### 2. New Availability Service Method
**File**: `src/services/availabilityService.ts`

**Added**:
```typescript
async checkServiceAvailabilityRange(
  serviceId: string,
  vendorId: string,
  startDate: string,
  endDate: string
): Promise<Map<string, AvailabilityCheck>>
```

**Logic**:
1. Fetch ALL bookings for vendor
2. **Filter by service_id** (this is the key difference!)
3. Check availability per date for THIS SERVICE only
4. Return service-specific availability map

### 3. Updated Booking Modal
**File**: `src/modules/services/components/BookingRequestModal.tsx`

**Changed**:
```typescript
<BookingAvailabilityCalendar
  vendorId={service?.vendorId}
  serviceId={service?.id}  // NEW: Pass service ID
  selectedDate={formData.eventDate}
  onDateSelect={(date, availability) => {...}}
/>
```

## 🎯 **API FLOW:**

### When User Opens Booking Modal:

```javascript
// 1. User clicks "Book Now" on "Premium Photography"
Service: {
  id: "SRV-0001",           // ← This is now used!
  vendorId: "2-2025-001",
  name: "Premium Photography"
}

// 2. Calendar makes API call
GET /api/bookings/vendor/2-2025-001?startDate=2025-10-01&endDate=2025-11-30

// 3. API returns ALL bookings for vendor (10 bookings)
{
  bookings: [
    { service_id: "SRV-0001", event_date: "2025-10-21", ... },
    { service_id: "SRV-00004", event_date: "2025-10-24", ... },
    { service_id: "SRV-0002", event_date: "2025-10-21", ... },
    // ... 7 more bookings
  ]
}

// 4. Frontend FILTERS by service_id = "SRV-0001"
Filtered bookings: [
  { service_id: "SRV-0001", event_date: "2025-10-21", ... },
  { service_id: "SRV-0001", event_date: "2025-10-22", ... }
]

// 5. Calendar shows ONLY these dates as red
Oct 21 = RED
Oct 22 = RED
All other dates = GREEN
```

---

## 🔍 **CONSOLE LOGS TO VERIFY:**

When calendar loads, you should see:

```javascript
📅 [BookingCalendar] Loading availability for: {
  vendorId: "2-2025-001", 
  serviceId: "SRV-0001",  // ← Service ID is now logged!
  startStr: "2025-09-27", 
  endStr: "2025-11-07"
}

🎯 [AvailabilityService] SERVICE-SPECIFIC availability check: {
  serviceId: "SRV-0001", 
  vendorId: "2-2025-001", 
  startDate: "2025-09-27", 
  endDate: "2025-11-07"
}

📅 [AvailabilityService] Filtered 2 bookings for service SRV-0001 (out of 10 total)
// ↑ This shows it's filtering!

✅ [AvailabilityService] SERVICE-SPECIFIC check completed: 42 dates processed
```

---

## ✅ **BENEFITS:**

### 1. **More Booking Opportunities**
- Vendor can offer multiple similar services
- Each service has independent availability
- More revenue potential!

### 2. **Accurate Availability**
- Users see real availability for specific service
- No false "unavailable" dates
- Better user experience

### 3. **Flexible Service Packages**
- Vendor can create multiple packages:
  - "Basic Photography"
  - "Premium Photography"
  - "Deluxe Photography with Video"
- Each with its own availability

### 4. **Scalable**
- Add unlimited services
- Each automatically gets its own calendar
- No configuration needed

---

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT NOTES:**

### Limitation: One Event Per Day Per Vendor
Even with per-service availability, the system still assumes:
- A vendor can only do **ONE** event per day
- This is realistic for wedding vendors

**Example**:
- Vendor has "Photography A" and "Photography B"
- If "Photography A" is booked on Oct 21
- "Photography B" shows Oct 21 as available
- **BUT** if someone books "Photography B" on Oct 21
- The vendor now has 2 bookings on the same day!

**Current Logic**: `maxBookingsPerDay = 1` per service

**If you want**: Multiple bookings of the SAME service on the same day:
- Change `maxBookingsPerDay` to a higher number
- Or make it configurable per service

---

## 🔧 **FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:**

### 1. Configurable Max Bookings Per Day
```typescript
// Per service
service: {
  id: "SRV-0001",
  maxBookingsPerDay: 3  // Can handle 3 clients per day
}
```

### 2. Time Slot Availability
```typescript
// Per service per time slot
Oct 21, Morning (8am-12pm): Available
Oct 21, Afternoon (1pm-5pm): Booked
Oct 21, Evening (6pm-10pm): Available
```

### 3. Resource-Based Availability
```typescript
// Multiple photographers in one vendor
Photographer A: Available
Photographer B: Booked
Photographer C: Available
```

## 🎊 **SUMMARY:**

### Even if Same Vendor:
- Vendor offers Photography A, Photography B, Catering
- Each service gets independent availability
- Booking Photography A doesn't block Photography B! 🎉

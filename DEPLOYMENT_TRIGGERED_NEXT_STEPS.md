## üîÑ Render Auto-Deploy Status

### Expected Deployment Timeline
1. **Detection**: Render detects new commit (0-30 seconds)
2. **Build Start**: Render starts build process (30-60 seconds)
3. **Install Dependencies**: `cd backend-deploy && npm install` (1-2 minutes)
4. **Start Server**: `node backend-deploy/production-backend.js` (10-20 seconds)
5. **Health Check**: Render verifies server is running (30 seconds)
6. **Live**: Deployment complete and live (~3-5 minutes total)

### How to Monitor Deployment
1. **Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com/
   - Navigate to your service: `weddingbazaar-web`
   - Click on "Events" tab to see deployment progress
   - Watch logs in real-time during deployment

2. **Check Deployment Logs**:
   ```
   - Look for: "Installing dependencies..."
   - Look for: "Starting server..."
   - Look for: "Server running on port 3001"
   - Look for: "‚úì Subscription system initialized"
   ```

3. **Health Check Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   # Wait 5 minutes, then test:
   curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/health
   
   # Expected response:
   {
     "status": "ok",
     "timestamp": "2024-...",
     "environment": "production",
     "database": "connected"
   }
   ```

## üß™ Post-Deployment Verification

### Step 1: Verify Core Endpoints (5 minutes after push)

```bash
# 1. Health Check
curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/health

# 2. Subscription Plans
curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/subscriptions/plans

# 3. Ping Test
curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/ping
```

**Expected Results**:
- Health: `200 OK` with status object
- Plans: `200 OK` with array of 3 plans (basic, professional, premium)
- Ping: `200 OK` with "pong"

### Step 2: Verify Subscription Endpoints (10 minutes after push)

```bash
# 1. Get vendor subscription (requires auth token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/subscriptions/vendor

# 2. Check usage limits (requires auth token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/subscriptions/usage/limits

# 3. Get analytics (requires auth token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/subscriptions/analytics
```

### Step 3: Test Payment Integration (15 minutes after push)

```bash
# 1. Create payment intent
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"planCode":"professional","paymentMethod":"card"}' \
  https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/subscriptions/payment/create-intent

# 2. Process test payment (use PayMongo test card)
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "planCode":"professional",
    "paymentMethodId":"pm_test_...",
    "paymentIntentId":"pi_test_..."
  }' \
  https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/subscriptions/payment/process
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails

1. **Check Render Logs**:
   - Go to Render Dashboard > Your Service > Logs
   - Look for error messages in red
   - Common issues: Missing dependencies, syntax errors, environment variables

2. **Common Errors**:
   ```
   Error: Cannot find module 'express'
   Fix: Check package.json in backend-deploy/
   
   Error: DATABASE_URL not found
   Fix: Verify environment variables in Render dashboard
   
   Error: Syntax error in subscriptions/index.cjs
   Fix: Check for typos or missing commas
   ```

3. **Rollback Strategy**:
   ```bash
   # If deployment fails, rollback to previous commit
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

### If Endpoints Return 404

1. **Check Router Registration**:
   - Verify `production-backend.js` has:
     ```javascript
     const subscriptionRoutes = require('./routes/subscriptions/index.cjs');
     app.use('/api/subscriptions', subscriptionRoutes);
     ```

2. **Check Module Path**:
   - Ensure `backend-deploy/routes/subscriptions/index.cjs` exists
   - Verify all module exports are correct

3. **Test Endpoint Directly**:
   ```bash
   curl -v https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/subscriptions/plans
   # Look for 404 or 200 in response headers
   ```

# Environment Configuration Fix - Complete ✅

## 🐛 Issue Identified
The local development environment was connecting to `localhost:3001` instead of the production backend, causing:
- Only 12 services displayed instead of 80+
- Missing vendor data
- Authentication issues
- Booking system not working properly

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **environment file precedence** in Vite:
1. **Main `.env` file**: Correctly set to production backend (`https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com`)
2. **Development `.env.development` file**: Overriding with `http://localhost:3001`
3. **Vite behavior**: `.env.development` takes precedence over `.env` during development

## 🛠️ Fix Applied

### File: `.env.development`
**Before:**
```bash
# API Configuration - Local Backend for Development
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Production Backend (commented out)
# VITE_API_URL=https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com
```

**After:**
```bash
# API Configuration - Use Production Backend for Development (more data available)
VITE_API_URL=https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com

# Local Backend (commented out - only has 12 services vs 80+ on production)
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

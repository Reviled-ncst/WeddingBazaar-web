## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES & FUTURE WORK

### Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)
- ⚠️ Image upload is placeholder (needs cloud storage integration)
- ⚠️ Integration test endpoints simulate success (need real API testing)
- ⚠️ API keys stored in plain text (need encryption)
- ⚠️ Custom domain doesn't validate DNS yet

### Future Enhancements
1. **Phase 1** (1-2 weeks):
   - Implement real image upload (AWS S3/Cloudinary)
   - Add API key encryption
   - Real integration testing logic
   - DNS validation for custom domains

2. **Phase 2** (2-3 weeks):
   - OAuth 2.0 for integrations
   - Advanced analytics (ML predictions)
   - Mobile app (React Native)
   - Email templates customization

3. **Phase 3** (1-2 months):
   - Integration marketplace for third-party devs
   - Zapier connector
   - Advanced team collaboration (chat, video calls)
   - Client-facing mobile app

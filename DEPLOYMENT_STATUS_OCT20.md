curl -X POST https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/services \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "vendor_id": "test",
    "title": "Test Service",
    "category": "Photography"
  }'
```
Expected: 201 Created (not 404)

### Option 3: Check Render Dashboard
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find `weddingbazaar-web` service
3. Check "Events" tab
4. Look for "Deploy succeeded" message

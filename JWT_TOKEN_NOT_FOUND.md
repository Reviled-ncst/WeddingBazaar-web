# üö® CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

## Problem: JWT Token Not Found in localStorage

### Evidence from Logs

The upgrade process starts but **stops immediately** after attempting to get the JWT token:

```javascript
üì• Step 3: Getting backend JWT token from localStorage...
üö™ [UpgradePrompt] Payment modal onClose called  ‚Üê Modal closes (indicates error)
```

**Missing logs (should appear but don't):**
- ‚úÖ Step 4: Backend JWT token validated
- üì¶ Step 5: Building upgrade payload
- üì§ Step 6: Making API call
- üì• Step 7: Response status
- ‚úÖ Step 8: Success

### Root Cause

The JWT token (`auth_token`) is **NOT in localStorage**!

When the code tries to get it:
```typescript
let token = localStorage.getItem('auth_token');  // Returns null!
if (!token) {
  token = localStorage.getItem('token');  // Also null!
}
if (!token) {
  throw new Error('Authentication token not found');  // ‚Üê Throws here!
}
```

The error is thrown, payment modal closes, and the upgrade fails silently.

## Why is the Token Missing?

### Possible Reasons:

1. **Token was never set during login**
   - Login flow may have changed
   - Token storage logic may have been modified

2. **Token was cleared**
   - Browser cache cleared removed it
   - Logout cleared it
   - Session expired

3. **Token is stored under different key**
   - May be under 'jwt_token' or 'sessionToken'
   - Backend may have changed the key name

## üîç DIAGNOSIS: Check localStorage

Run this in the browser console:

```javascript
// Check all possible token keys
console.log('auth_token:', localStorage.getItem('auth_token'));
console.log('token:', localStorage.getItem('token'));
console.log('jwt_token:', localStorage.getItem('jwt_token'));
console.log('sessionToken:', localStorage.getItem('sessionToken'));

// Check all localStorage keys
console.log('All keys:', Object.keys(localStorage));

// Check if user data exists
console.log('backend_user:', localStorage.getItem('backend_user'));
console.log('weddingbazaar_user_profile:', localStorage.getItem('weddingbazaar_user_profile'));
```

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION

### Option 1: Log Out and Log Back In

This will regenerate the JWT token:

1. Click "Logout" in the app
2. Log back in with your credentials
3. **Check console for token storage:**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem('auth_token', ...)  ‚Üê Should see this
   ```
4. Try the upgrade again

### Option 2: Manually Check Token Storage

If you see the token in a different key, we need to update the code to use that key.

### Option 3: Fix Token Storage in Login Flow

The login flow in `AuthContext.tsx` should be setting the token, but it may not be working correctly.

## üîß Temporary Fix: Use Alternative Token

Let me check what token keys are actually available and update the code to use them.

## üìä Expected Flow

**What SHOULD happen:**

1. User logs in
2. Backend returns JWT token
3. Frontend stores token: `localStorage.setItem('auth_token', token)`
4. Later, upgrade flow retrieves token: `localStorage.getItem('auth_token')`
5. Token is sent to backend
6. Backend validates and processes upgrade

**What's HAPPENING:**

1. User logs in ‚úÖ
2. Backend returns token ‚úÖ (probably)
3. Token stored somewhere ‚ùì (maybe wrong key)
4. Upgrade flow tries to get token ‚Üí **NOT FOUND!** ‚ùå
5. Error thrown ‚Üí Modal closes ‚ùå
6. Upgrade fails ‚ùå

## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Please run these commands in the browser console and share the output:**

```javascript
// 1. Check all token keys
console.log({
  auth_token: localStorage.getItem('auth_token'),
  token: localStorage.getItem('token'),
  jwt_token: localStorage.getItem('jwt_token'),
  sessionToken: localStorage.getItem('sessionToken'),
  all_keys: Object.keys(localStorage)
});

// 2. Check user data
const backendUser = localStorage.getItem('backend_user');
if (backendUser) {
  console.log('Backend user:', JSON.parse(backendUser));
}

// 3. Try logging in again and watch for token storage
// Look for this log during login:
// localStorage.setItem('auth_token', ...)
```

## üö® CRITICAL FIX NEEDED

Based on the output, I'll update the code to:
1. Use the correct token key
2. Add better error handling
3. Show user-friendly error message
4. Add fallback token retrieval methods

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED - Need to identify correct token storage key  
**Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Payment succeeded but upgrade failed  
**Next Step:** Check localStorage for token or log out/in to regenerate

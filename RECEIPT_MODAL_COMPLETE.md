### 2. **bookingActionsService.ts** (Already Exists)

**Existing Functionality**:

- `Receipt` interface: TypeScript type for receipt data
- `formatReceipt(receipt)`: Formats receipt for console display

## üîÑ Data Flow

### Fetching Receipts
```
1. User clicks "View Receipt" button
2. ReceiptModal opens (isOpen=true)
3. useEffect triggers loadReceipts()
4. API call: GET /api/payment/receipts/:bookingId
5. Backend queries receipts table
6. Returns array of receipt objects
7. Frontend stores in receipts state
8. Displays payment history and summary
```

### Balance Calculation
```
Total Paid = Sum of all receipt amounts (converted from centavos)
Remaining Balance = Total Amount - Total Paid
Is Fully Paid = Remaining Balance <= 0
```

### Receipt Data Structure
```typescript
interface Receipt {
  id: string;
  bookingId: string;
  receiptNumber: string;
  paymentType: string;          // 'deposit', 'balance', 'full'
  amount: number;                // Amount in centavos (10000 = ‚Ç±100)
  currency: string;              // 'PHP'
  paymentMethod: string;         // 'card', 'gcash', 'paymaya', 'grab_pay'
  paymentIntentId: string;       // PayMongo transaction ID
  paidBy: string;                // User ID
  paidByName: string;            // Customer name
  paidByEmail: string;           // Customer email
  vendorId: string;              // Vendor ID
  vendorName: string;            // Vendor name
  serviceType: string;           // Service category
  eventDate: string;             // Event date
  totalPaid: number;             // Running total in centavos
  remainingBalance: number;      // Remaining in centavos
  notes?: string;                // Additional notes
  createdAt: string;             // Transaction timestamp
}
```

GET https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/payment/receipts/:bookingId
Response: { success: true, receipts: [...] }
```

## üêõ Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "No receipts found"
**Cause**: Booking has no payment records in receipts table
**Solution**: Make a test payment first, or check if receipt was created during payment

### Issue 2: Balance doesn't match
**Cause**: Receipt amounts might be in centavos
**Solution**: Implementation now divides by 100 automatically

### Issue 3: Modal doesn't open
**Cause**: Missing or null booking data
**Solution**: Ensure booking object has all required fields

### Issue 4: Print window blocked
**Cause**: Browser popup blocker
**Solution**: User must allow popups for the site

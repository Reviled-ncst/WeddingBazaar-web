## üé® UI Components Added

### Mark as Complete Button (Vendor Side)
```tsx
{(booking.status === 'fully_paid' || booking.status === 'paid_in_full') && (
  <button
    onClick={() => handleMarkComplete(booking)}
    className="flex-1 lg:flex-none flex items-center justify-center gap-2 px-4 py-2 bg-gradient-to-r from-green-500 to-emerald-500 text-white rounded-lg hover:from-green-600 hover:to-emerald-600 transition-all duration-300 text-sm font-medium hover:shadow-lg hover:scale-105"
  >
    <CheckCircle className="h-4 w-4" />
    Mark as Complete
  </button>
)}
```

**Features**:
- Green gradient background (wedding bazaar theme)
- CheckCircle icon from lucide-react
- Smooth hover effects with scale and shadow
- Only shows for fully paid bookings
- Triggers `handleMarkComplete` function

### Completed Badge (Both Sides)
```tsx
{booking.status === 'completed' && (
  <div className="flex-1 lg:flex-none px-4 py-2 bg-gradient-to-r from-pink-100 to-purple-100 border-2 border-pink-300 text-pink-700 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center gap-2 font-semibold text-sm">
    <Heart className="h-4 w-4 fill-current" />
    Completed ‚úì
  </div>
)}
```

**Features**:
- Pink/purple gradient (matches couple-side implementation)
- Heart icon with fill (romantic wedding theme)
- Shows after both vendor and couple confirm
- Replaces action buttons when booking is complete

## üîÑ Two-Sided Completion Flow

### State 1: Fully Paid (Initial)
- **Vendor Side**: Shows "Mark as Complete" button (green)
- **Couple Side**: Shows "Mark as Complete" button (green)
- **Database**: `vendor_completed = FALSE`, `couple_completed = FALSE`
- **Status**: `fully_paid` or `paid_in_full`

### State 2: One Party Confirms (Waiting)
- **If Vendor Confirms First**:
  - Vendor button text: "Waiting for Couple Confirmation" (disabled)
  - Couple sees: "Vendor has already confirmed. By confirming..."
  - Database: `vendor_completed = TRUE`, `couple_completed = FALSE`
  
- **If Couple Confirms First**:
  - Couple button text: "Waiting for Vendor Confirmation" (disabled)
  - Vendor sees: "Couple has already confirmed. By confirming..."
  - Database: `vendor_completed = FALSE`, `couple_completed = TRUE`

### State 3: Both Confirmed (Final)
- **Both Sides**: Show "Completed ‚úì" badge (pink with heart)
- **Database**: 
  - `vendor_completed = TRUE`
  - `couple_completed = TRUE`
  - `fully_completed = TRUE`
  - `status = 'completed'`
- **Buttons**: Replaced by completion badge

## üìù Additional Notes

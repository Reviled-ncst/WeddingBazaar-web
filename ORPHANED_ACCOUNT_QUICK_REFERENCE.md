- User can retry with SAME email ✅

### 2. Orphaned Account Detection
**Location**: `HybridAuthContext.tsx` (Line ~138)
- Detect orphaned accounts during login
- Automatically sign out orphaned Firebase user
- Show toast: "Registration incomplete. Please register again."
- Stop infinite loop immediately ✅

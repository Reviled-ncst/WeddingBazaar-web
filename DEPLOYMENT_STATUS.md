## ⏳ Deployment Timeline

### Backend Deployment (Render)
- [x] Code pushed to GitHub ✅
- [⏳] Render detects push (takes 1-2 minutes)
- [⏳] Build starts (takes 2-3 minutes)
- [⏳] Deploy to production (takes 1-2 minutes)
- [ ] Service restarts
- [ ] API available

**Estimated Time**: 5-10 minutes from push
**Pushed At**: Just now
**Expected Ready**: In 3-8 minutes

### Frontend Deployment (Already Live)
- [x] Code on GitHub ✅
- [x] Frontend integrated ✅
- [x] Will automatically use new API when ready ✅

## 🧪 How to Test

### Wait for Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# Wait 5 minutes, then test
timeout /t 300 /nobreak
node test-production-categories.mjs
```

### Test Now (May Fail Until Deployed)
```bash
node test-production-categories.mjs
```

### Manual Test
```bash
# This will work once deployment completes
curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/categories
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### When Deployment Completes

#### Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": X,
  "categories": [...],
  "schema": "legacy"  // Will be "new" after migration
}
```

#### Test Script Output
```
✅ Success! Fetched X categories
📂 Schema: legacy
✅ Categories Endpoint: Working
✅ Fields by ID Endpoint: Working
✅ Fields by Name Endpoint: Working
✅ All production API endpoints are working!
```

## 🎯 Post-Deployment Checklist

Once deployment completes (~5-10 minutes):

### Backend Verification
- [ ] Run: `node test-production-categories.mjs`
- [ ] Verify: API returns categories
- [ ] Check: Response includes `success: true`
- [ ] Confirm: No errors in response

### Frontend Verification
- [ ] Go to: https://weddingbazaar-web.web.app
- [ ] Login as vendor
- [ ] Click "Add New Service"
- [ ] Verify: Categories load in dropdown
- [ ] Select: Any category
- [ ] Verify: Form works without errors
- [ ] Navigate: Through all 5 steps
- [ ] Check: Step 5 appears (even if empty)

### Render Dashboard Check
- [ ] Open: https://dashboard.render.com
- [ ] Check: Latest deployment status
- [ ] Review: Build logs for errors
- [ ] Verify: Service is "Live"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Test Fails After 10 Minutes

#### Check Render Dashboard
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your service
3. Check "Events" tab
4. Look for deployment status
5. Check logs for errors

#### Check Backend Logs
```bash
# In Render dashboard
# Go to "Logs" tab
# Look for:
✅ Server started on port 10000
✅ Database connected
❌ Any error messages
```

#### Manual API Test
```bash
# Test if backend is responding at all
curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/health

# Should return:
{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"..."}
```

### If Categories Endpoint Returns Error

#### Check Response
```bash
curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/categories

# Look for error message
# Common issues:
- Database connection error
- Table not found (expected if no migration)
- Syntax error in SQL
```

#### Expected Behavior Without Migration
- ✅ Should work with `service_categories` table
- ✅ Returns categories with empty subcategories
- ✅ Response includes `schema: "legacy"`

## üß™ Step 4: Test Email Notifications

### Test Case 1: Email Configured (Production)

1. **Create Test Booking:**
   - Login as couple/individual user
   - Go to: https://weddingbazaarph.web.app/individual/services
   - Select a vendor service
   - Fill out booking form with test data:
     ```
     Service: Photography
     Event Date: 2025-12-15
     Location: Manila, Philippines
     Guest Count: 100
     Budget Range: ‚Ç±50,000 - ‚Ç±75,000
     Special Requests: "We need outdoor ceremony coverage"
     ```
   - Submit booking

2. **Verify Email Sent:**
   - Check vendor's email inbox (e.g., vendor@example.com)
   - Look for: **"üéâ New Booking Request from [Couple Name]"**
   - Verify email contains:
     - [x] Couple name and email
     - [x] Service type
     - [x] Event date (formatted nicely)
     - [x] Location
     - [x] Guest count
     - [x] Budget range
     - [x] Special requests
     - [x] "View Booking Details" button
     - [x] Direct link to vendor dashboard

3. **Check Backend Logs:**
   ```
   üìß Sending new booking notification to vendor: vendor@example.com
   ‚úÖ Vendor notification sent successfully: <message-id>
   ```

### Test Case 2: Email Not Configured (Development)

If `EMAIL_USER` or `EMAIL_PASS` not set:

1. Create booking (same as above)
2. **Check Render Logs:**
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Email service not configured - emails will be logged to console
   üìß EMAIL WOULD BE SENT TO: vendor@example.com
   üìß BOOKING URL: https://weddingbazaarph.web.app/vendor/bookings
   üìß EMAIL CONTENT:
   [Full email text displayed in logs]
   ```

3. Booking should still be created successfully
4. No errors should occur

### Test Case 3: Email Delivery Failure

1. Use invalid email credentials
2. Create booking
3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Booking created successfully ‚úÖ
   - Error logged (not thrown):
     ```
     ‚ùå Failed to send vendor notification email: Invalid credentials
     ```
   - Booking creation NOT affected

---

## üìä Step 5: Monitor and Verify

### Check Email Delivery:

**Gmail Dashboard:**
1. Go to: https://mail.google.com/
2. Login with `EMAIL_USER` account
3. Check "Sent" folder
4. Verify emails are being sent

**Render Logs:**
```bash
# Look for these messages:
‚úÖ Email service configured with: weddingbazaar@gmail.com
üìß Sending new booking notification to vendor: vendor@example.com
‚úÖ Vendor notification sent successfully: <1234567890.mail@smtp.gmail.com>
```

### Check Booking Creation:

**Database Query** (Neon SQL Editor):
```sql
SELECT 
  b.id,
  b.created_at,
  u.email as couple_email,
  vp.business_name as vendor_name,
  v_user.email as vendor_email
FROM bookings b
JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.id
JOIN vendor_profiles vp ON b.vendor_id = vp.id
JOIN users v_user ON vp.user_id = v_user.id
ORDER BY b.created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Monitor Error Rates:

**Render Logs - Filter for Errors:**
```bash
# Search in logs:
‚ùå Failed to send vendor notification email
‚ùå Error preparing vendor notification
```

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Email service not configured"

**Symptoms:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Email service not configured - emails will be logged to console
```

**Solution:**
1. Verify `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` are set in Render
2. Redeploy service after adding variables
3. Check logs for: `‚úÖ Email service configured with: ...`

---

### Issue: "Invalid login" or "Authentication failed"

**Symptoms:**
```
‚ùå Vendor notification email failed: Invalid login
```

**Solutions:**

**For Gmail:**
1. **Enable 2-Step Verification:**
   - Required for app passwords
   
2. **Generate NEW App Password:**
   - Old passwords may expire
   - Create new one specifically for this app
   
3. **Check Gmail Settings:**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps
   - Should NOT use "Less secure apps" anymore
   - MUST use App Passwords with 2FA
   
4. **Verify Email/Password:**
   - No typos in email address
   - App password has NO spaces
   - Password is exactly 16 characters

**For Other Providers:**
- Check SMTP settings in `emailService.cjs`
- Verify credentials are correct
- Check provider documentation

---

### Issue: Emails go to spam

**Solutions:**

1. **Set Up SPF Record:**
   ```
   TXT @ "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all"
   ```

2. **Set Up DKIM:**
   - Configure in Gmail admin console
   
3. **Use Professional Email:**
   - Consider: `noreply@weddingbazaarph.com`
   - Better than: `randomgmail123@gmail.com`
   
4. **Test with Mail Tester:**
   - Send test email to: check@mail-tester.com
   - Review spam score and recommendations

---

### Issue: Booking created but no email sent

**Symptoms:**
- Booking exists in database
- No email notification received
- No errors in logs

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Check Vendor Email Exists:**
   ```sql
   SELECT u.email 
   FROM vendor_profiles vp
   JOIN users u ON vp.user_id = u.id
   WHERE vp.id = '<vendor-id>';
   ```

2. **Check Logs for Email Attempt:**
   ```
   üìß Sending new booking notification to vendor: ...
   ```

3. **Verify Email Not Skipped:**
   Look for:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Vendor email not found, skipping notification
   ```

4. **Check Email Queue:**
   - Gmail may delay sending
   - Check "Sent" folder after 5-10 minutes

---

### Issue: Email HTML not rendering properly

**Symptoms:**
- Email looks plain text
- No colors or styling
- Broken layout

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Email Client:**
   - Gmail: Full HTML support ‚úÖ
   - Outlook: Limited CSS support ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Apple Mail: Good HTML support ‚úÖ
   
2. **Test in Different Clients:**
   - Use: https://www.emailonacid.com/
   - Or: https://litmus.com/
   
3. **Fallback to Plain Text:**
   - All emails include text version
   - Should display correctly even if HTML fails

---

## üìà Success Metrics

### KPIs to Monitor:

1. **Email Delivery Rate:**
   - Target: >95% successful deliveries
   - Calculate: (Emails sent successfully / Total bookings) √ó 100

2. **Email Open Rate:**
   - Target: >60% for vendor notifications
   - Track via: Email service analytics

3. **Vendor Response Time:**
   - Target: <24 hours
   - Measure: Time from booking to vendor response

4. **Booking Conversion Rate:**
   - Target: >40% of bookings confirmed
   - Measure: Confirmed bookings / Total bookings

### Analytics Query:
```sql
-- Email notification success rate (last 7 days)
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_bookings,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN vendor_notified = true THEN 1 END) as emails_sent,
  ROUND(
    COUNT(CASE WHEN vendor_notified = true THEN 1 END)::numeric / 
    COUNT(*)::numeric * 100, 
    2
  ) as success_rate_percent
FROM bookings
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

*Note: Requires adding `vendor_notified` column to track email status*

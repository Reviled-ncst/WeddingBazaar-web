## üéØ What Was Built

### 1. Database Layer
- **vendor_wallets** table (5 fields)
  - Tracks total earnings, available balance, pending balance, withdrawn amount
  - Unique vendor_id with currency support (PHP default)
  
- **wallet_transactions** table (18 fields)
  - Complete transaction audit trail
  - Types: earning, withdrawal, refund, adjustment
  - Status tracking: pending, completed, failed, cancelled
  - Rich metadata: service details, customer info, event dates

- **6 Performance Indexes**
  - Optimized for vendor lookups, transaction queries, date sorting

### 2. Backend API (3 Endpoints)
- `GET /api/vendor/wallet/balance` - Get wallet summary
- `GET /api/vendor/wallet/transactions` - Get transaction history with pagination
- `GET /api/vendor/wallet/statistics` - Get earnings statistics

### 3. Frontend Implementation
- **VendorWallet.tsx** page with:
  - Real-time balance display
  - Transaction history table
  - Filtering and pagination
  - Mobile-responsive design
  - Earnings overview cards

### 4. Automatic Integration
- Wallet entries auto-created when bookings completed
- Transactions generated from two-sided completion
- Balance updates in real-time
- Migration of existing completed bookings

## ‚úÖ What Works

### Automatic Wallet Creation
1. Couple pays for booking (deposit or full)
2. Booking status: `fully_paid` or `paid_in_full`
3. Couple marks booking as complete
4. Vendor marks booking as complete
5. **Wallet entry created automatically**
6. **Transaction recorded with full details**
7. **Balance updated in real-time**

### Wallet Dashboard
1. Vendor logs in
2. Navigates to `/vendor/wallet`
3. Sees current balance (total earnings, available, pending)
4. Views transaction history with:
   - Service name and category
   - Customer information
   - Event dates
   - Payment methods
   - Transaction amounts
   - Timestamps

### Transaction Filtering
1. Filter by transaction type (earning, withdrawal, etc.)
2. Filter by status (completed, pending, etc.)
3. Pagination support (default 10 per page)
4. Sort by date (newest first)

2. Verify vendor_id exists
3. Check backend logs in Render
4. Run manual wallet creation query

### If Balance Incorrect
1. Run balance recalculation query
2. Check transaction status (only 'completed' counts)
3. Verify transaction type ('earning' adds to balance)

### If Transactions Missing
1. Check transaction_id uniqueness
2. Verify booking_id valid
3. Check ON CONFLICT clause didn't skip insert

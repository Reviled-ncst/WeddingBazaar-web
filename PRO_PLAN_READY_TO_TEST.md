## 🐛 WHAT WAS FIXED

### The Problem
Pro plan subscription upgrades were failing with **402 Payment Required** error after successful PayMongo payment.

### Root Cause Discovered
Backend was checking for `payment_reference` field, but frontend was sending payment data under these field names:
- `transactionId: "pi_BvhbGSrU8QkkoTiiDGX6qeHQ"`
- `sourceId: "pi_BvhbGSrU8QkkoTiiDGX6qeHQ"`
- `paymentIntent.id: "pi_BvhbGSrU8QkkoTiiDGX6qeHQ"`
- `payment.id: "pi_BvhbGSrU8QkkoTiiDGX6qeHQ"`

Backend wasn't recognizing any of these → tried to re-process payment → **402 error**

### The Fix
Updated backend to check **all possible payment field names**:
```javascript
const paymentAlreadyProcessed = payment_method_details?.transactionId || 
                                payment_method_details?.sourceId ||
                                payment_method_details?.paymentIntent?.id ||
                                payment_method_details?.payment?.id;
```

Now backend detects payment from ANY of these fields and skips re-processing ✅

## 🔄 Backend Integration (Next Steps)

### **Current State**: Frontend Only
The package selector is now live and functional in the UI, but backend integration is pending.

### **Required Backend Changes**:

1. **Update Booking API** (`backend-deploy/routes/bookings.cjs`):
   ```javascript
   // Add selectedPackage to booking creation
   const { 
     eventDate, eventTime, eventLocation, 
     guestCount, budgetRange, selectedPackage,  // ✅ ADD THIS
     // ...other fields
   } = req.body;
   
   // Validate selectedPackage
   if (!selectedPackage) {
     return res.status(400).json({ 
       error: 'Package selection is required' 
     });
   }
   ```

2. **Update Database Schema** (if not already present):
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE bookings 
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS selected_package VARCHAR(50);
   ```

3. **Include in Booking Responses**:
   - Add `selectedPackage` to booking objects returned by API
   - Display in booking details views
   - Include in confirmation emails

4. **Test Backend**:
   - POST /api/bookings with `selectedPackage` field
   - Verify data is stored correctly
   - Check booking retrieval includes package info

## 📝 Data Flow

### **Frontend → Backend**:
```javascript
// Booking request payload now includes:

  "eventTime": "14:00",
  "eventLocation": "Manila Hotel",
  "guestCount": "150",
  "budgetRange": "₱50,000-₱100,000",
  "selectedPackage": "premium",  // ✅ NEW FIELD
  "specialRequests": "...",
  // ...other fields
}
```

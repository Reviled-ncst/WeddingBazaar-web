## 🔍 Expected Console Output

When you click "Upgrade to Premium" (or Pro/Enterprise), you should see this **exact sequence** in the console:

### Part 1: Button Click Handler

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 [UpgradePrompt] UPGRADE BUTTON CLICKED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 Plan Details: {
  planId: "premium",
  planName: "Premium",
  planPrice: 5,
  planDisplayPrice: "₱5.00",
  planFeatures: 6,
  isHighlighted: true,
  isCurrent: false,
  isPopular: true
}
🔒 State Before Processing: {
  isProcessing: false,
  paymentModalOpen: false,
  hasSelectedPlan: false,
  selectedPlanName: "none",
  currency: "PHP",
  currencyRate: 1
}
✅ Proceeding with upgrade process...
🔐 isProcessing set to TRUE to prevent double-clicks

💳 PAID PLAN DETECTED - OPENING PAYMENT MODAL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💵 Price Conversion: {
  originalPricePHP: 5,
  targetCurrency: "PHP",
  exchangeRate: 1,
  convertedAmount: "5.00",
  displayPrice: "₱5.00"
}

📝 SETTING MODAL STATE (CRITICAL STEP)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📝 Selected Plan Object to be stored: {
  id: "premium",
  name: "Premium",
  price: 5,
  displayPrice: "₱5.00",
  fullPlanObject: { ... }
}
🔧 Calling setSelectedPlan()...
✅ setSelectedPlan() called - plan will be available on next render
🔧 Calling setPaymentModalOpen(true)...
✅ setPaymentModalOpen(true) called - modal will open on next render

⏳ STATE UPDATE QUEUED (React will re-render component):
   • selectedPlan: will be Premium
   • paymentModalOpen: will be TRUE
   • PayMongoPaymentModal: will render via createPortal

🎬 NEXT: Component will re-render and show payment modal
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Part 2: Component Re-Render (Payment Modal Evaluation)

After the state update, React will re-render and you should see:

```
🎭 ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔍 [UpgradePrompt] PAYMENT MODAL RENDER EVALUATION
🎭 ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📊 State Check: {
  hasSelectedPlan: true,
  selectedPlanName: "Premium",
  selectedPlanId: "premium",
  selectedPlanPrice: 5,
  paymentModalOpen: true,
  willRender: true,
  timestamp: "2025-10-29T..."
}

✅ ✅ ✅ WILL RENDER PayMongoPaymentModal ✅ ✅ ✅
🚀 Creating portal to document.body with PayMongoPaymentModal

   • booking.serviceType: Premium Subscription
   • amount: 5
   • currency: PHP

🎭 ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Part 3: Payment Modal Opens (If Successful)

If the modal opens correctly, you should see:
- ✅ Payment modal appears on screen
- ✅ Card payment form is visible
- ✅ Amount shows ₱5.00 (or converted currency)

## 🚫 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Modal Does NOT Open

**If you see this in console:**
```
❌ ❌ ❌ WILL NOT RENDER PayMongoPaymentModal ❌ ❌ ❌
🚫 Reason: {
  hasSelectedPlan: ✅ YES
  paymentModalOpen: ❌ NO (this is the problem!)
  bothRequired: Both must be TRUE to render
}
```

**Possible Causes:**
1. ⚠️ `setPaymentModalOpen(true)` was called but state didn't update
2. ⚠️ React is not re-rendering after state change
3. ⚠️ State update is being cancelled somewhere
4. ⚠️ Component is unmounting before re-render

**Next Steps:**
- Screenshot the **entire console log** from clicking "Upgrade" to the error
- Share in GitHub issue or Slack
- Include: Browser version, OS, any errors above the logs

### Issue 2: Modal Opens But No Payment Processing

**Symptoms:**
- ✅ Modal appears
- ❌ No payment form
- ❌ Blank modal or error message

**Possible Causes:**
1. PayMongoPaymentModal component error
2. Payment service initialization failed
3. Missing PayMongo API keys

**Check Console For:**
- Any red errors from PayMongoPaymentModal
- Network errors (404, 500, etc.)
- CORS errors

### Issue 3: No Logging Appears At All

**Possible Causes:**
1. ❌ **Browser cache not cleared** (most common!)
2. ❌ Using old deployment URL
3. ❌ Console is filtered (check filter settings)

**Solutions:**
1. **Force clear cache**: Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Clear ALL data
2. **Use incognito window**: Ctrl+Shift+N (guaranteed fresh)
3. **Check console filter**: Ensure it's set to "All levels" not "Errors only"
4. **Verify URL**: https://weddingbazaarph.web.app (NOT weddingbazaar-web.web.app)

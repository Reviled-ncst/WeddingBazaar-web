## 🎯 Where You Left Off

### ✅ Completed This Session
1. Enhanced Cultural Specialties section with:
   - Selection counter and "Clear all" button
   - Smart validation messages
   - Rich tooltips for each specialty
   - Analytics tracking foundation
   - Improved accessibility

2. Diagnosed Service API issue:
   - POST /api/services returning 404

### ⏳ Immediate Next Steps

**CRITICAL: Deploy Backend First**
1. Go to Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click "Manual Deploy" on `weddingbazaar-web` service
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment
4. Run test: `node diagnose-service-api.mjs`
5. Verify all tests pass

**Then: Deploy Frontend**
```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

```
**Expected:** All 4 tests should pass ✅

### 2. Frontend Verification
1. Login as vendor
2. Go to "My Services"
3. Click "Add Service"
4. Test cultural specialties:
   - Select 0 items → Should show warning
   - Select 5+ items → Should show success message
   - Hover over specialty → Should show tooltip
   - Click "Clear all" → All items deselected
5. Fill form and submit
6. Verify service created successfully

## 🔍 Quick Status Check

Run these commands to verify current state:

```bash
# Check if latest code is committed
git log --oneline --max-count=5

# Check if changes are on GitHub
git status

# Test current API status
node diagnose-service-api.mjs

# Check frontend build status
npm run build
```

## 🚨 Known Issues

### Backend (CRITICAL)
- ❌ POST /api/services returns 404
- **Cause:** Render not deployed
- **Fix:** Manual deploy via Render dashboard

### Frontend (Minor)
- ⏳ Cultural specialties enhancements not in production
- **Fix:** Deploy to Firebase after backend is fixed

---

## 📊 Success Criteria

After completing deployment:

### Backend
- [x] POST /api/services returns 201 (not 404)
- [x] Service creation works from frontend
- [x] DSS fields are saved correctly
- [x] Diagnostic tool shows all tests passing

### Frontend
- [x] Cultural specialties counter works
- [x] "Clear all" button works
- [x] Validation messages appear
- [x] Tooltips show on hover
- [x] Form submits successfully

---

## 💡 If Something Goes Wrong

### Backend Deployment Fails
1. Check Render logs for errors
2. Verify `backend-deploy/index.ts` is correct
3. Check database connection
4. Try empty commit: `git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger deploy"`

### Frontend Build Fails
1. Check for TypeScript errors: `npm run build`
2. Fix any import issues
3. Clear node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

### Tests Still Fail After Deployment
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Render to fully restart
2. Check Render logs for startup errors
3. Verify backend URL is correct: https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com
4. Try accessing health endpoint: `curl https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/health`

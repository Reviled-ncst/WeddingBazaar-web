# 🚀 CALENDAR FIX DEPLOYED - PRODUCTION READY!

**Deployment Date**: October 22, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **LIVE IN PRODUCTION**
**URL**: https://weddingbazaarph.web.app

---

## ✅ **DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL!**

### What Was Fixed:
**Issue**: Calendar showing all dates as green (available) despite 10 existing bookings
**Root Cause**: Vendor ID mapping error - API was called with "2" instead of "2-2025-001"
**Solution**: Removed incorrect vendor ID mapping in `availabilityService.ts`

### Code Change:
```typescript
// BEFORE (Wrong):
private mapVendorIdForBookings(vendorId: string): string {
  if (vendorId.startsWith('2-2025-')) {
    return '2';  // ❌ API returned 0 bookings
  }
  return vendorId;
}

// AFTER (Fixed):
private mapVendorIdForBookings(vendorId: string): string {
  return vendorId;  // ✅ Use full vendor ID "2-2025-001"
}
```

## 🐛 **TROUBLESHOOTING:**

### Issue: Still seeing all green dates

**Solution 1: Clear Cache**
```
Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows)
Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
```

**Solution 2: Wait for CDN**
- Firebase CDN may take 1-2 minutes to propagate
- Try in incognito/private window

**Solution 3: Check Console**
- Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab
- Look for any errors
- Verify "Retrieved 10 bookings" appears

### Issue: Console shows "Retrieved 0 bookings"

**Check**:
- You're logged in as the correct user
- You're booking a service from vendor "2-2025-001"
- Network tab shows API call to correct URL

### Issue: Calendar doesn't load

**Check**:
- Console for JavaScript errors
- Network tab for failed API calls
- Try different service (Baker vs Catering)

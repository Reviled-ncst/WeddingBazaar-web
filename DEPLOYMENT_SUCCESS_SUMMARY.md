## üéØ Feature Summary

### What Users Will See:

**For Couples** (‚úÖ Live Now):
1. Navigate to Bookings page
2. Find any booking with "Fully Paid" status
3. See green "Mark as Complete" button
4. Click button ‚Üí Confirmation modal appears
5. Confirm ‚Üí Booking marked complete
6. If vendor also confirms ‚Üí Status becomes "Completed ‚úì"

**For Vendors** (üöß Coming Next):
- Same button will appear on vendor bookings page
- Vendor can also mark bookings as complete
- When both parties confirm ‚Üí Booking fully completed

### How It Works:

```
Step 1: Booking is fully paid
   ‚Üì
Step 2: Either party marks complete (couple OR vendor)
   - Updates their completion flag in database
   - Status remains "Fully Paid"
   - Button becomes disabled for that party
   ‚Üì
Step 3: Other party also marks complete
   - Updates their completion flag
   - System detects both flags are TRUE
   - Status changes to "Completed"
   - Both parties can now leave reviews
```

## üìä Technical Implementation

### Database:
```sql
-- New columns added to bookings table
vendor_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
vendor_completed_at TIMESTAMP
couple_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
couple_completed_at TIMESTAMP
fully_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
fully_completed_at TIMESTAMP
completion_notes TEXT
```

### Backend Endpoint:
```
POST /api/bookings/:bookingId/mark-completed
Body: {
  "completed_by": "couple" | "vendor",
  "notes": "Optional notes"
}
```

### Frontend Button:

<button className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-500 to-emerald-500...">
  <CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4" />
  Mark as Complete
</button>
```

## üéì Key Learnings from Today

### Issue Encountered:
‚ùå **Frontend not deployed initially**
- Code was committed to Git
- Backend auto-deployed via Render
- Frontend was NOT deployed to Firebase

### Root Cause:
The deployment flow requires TWO separate steps:
1. **Backend**: Auto-deploys from GitHub (‚úÖ worked)
2. **Frontend**: Requires manual `firebase deploy --only hosting` (‚ùå forgot)

### Solution Applied:
```powershell
npm run build              # Build frontend
firebase deploy --only hosting  # Deploy to Firebase
```

### Lesson Learned:
**Always remember the two-step deployment:**
1. Git push ‚Üí Backend deploys automatically
2. Firebase deploy ‚Üí Frontend requires manual command

# 🚀 Quick Test Guide - Vendor Subscription Fix

## ✅ What Was Fixed
**Problem**: All vendors were shown as "Premium" instead of their actual subscription  
**Cause**: Hardcoded mock data in VendorSubscription.tsx  
**Solution**: Now fetches real subscription data from backend API

---

## 🧪 Quick Test (30 seconds)

### 1. Open Production Site
```
https://weddingbazaarph.web.app/vendor/subscription
```

### 2. What You Should See Now

#### If You're a New Vendor (No Subscription)
- ✅ Plan name: **"Basic"** (not "Premium")
- ✅ Price: **$0/month**
- ✅ Limits: 3 services, 10 bookings/month
- ✅ Status: "active"

#### If You Have an Active Subscription
- ✅ Your actual plan name (Basic, Premium, or Enterprise)
- ✅ Your actual price and billing date
- ✅ Your real usage metrics
- ✅ Current subscription status

### 3. Test Upgrade Flow
1. Click **"Upgrade Plan"** button (top right)
2. Should see plan comparison modal
3. Your current plan should be highlighted
4. Other plans should show "Upgrade" button

---

## 🔍 Verify Fix is Working

### Browser Console (F12)
```javascript
// Should see this log:
"🔍 Fetching subscription for vendor: [your-vendor-id]"

// Should NOT see:
"Using mock subscription data"
```

### Network Tab (F12 → Network)
```
Request: GET /api/subscriptions/vendor/[your-id]
Status: 200 OK
Response: { subscription: { plan_id: "basic", ... } }
```

---

## ❌ What NOT to See Anymore
- ❌ "Premium" plan if you haven't subscribed
- ❌ Mock data (sub_123, vendor_id: '2-2025-003')
- ❌ Fake usage metrics
- ❌ Static "August 2025" dates

---

## 🎯 Success Indicators
✅ Plan matches your database record  
✅ Usage counts are real (not 3, 25, 45, etc.)  
✅ Billing date is accurate (if subscribed)  
✅ Upgrade button works correctly  
✅ No console errors

## 🚨 If Something's Wrong

### Still Shows Premium (But You Didn't Subscribe)
**Fix**: Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Shows Loading Forever
**Fix**: Check if backend is running:  
https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/health

### Shows "Failed to load subscription"
**Check**:
1. Are you logged in as a vendor?
2. Does your account have a vendor_id?
3. Is backend API accessible?

---

## 📊 Expected Data Flow

```
1. You open /vendor/subscription
   ↓
2. Frontend calls: GET /api/subscriptions/vendor/[your-id]
   ↓
3. Backend checks database for your subscription
   ↓
4. If found: Returns your plan (Premium, Enterprise, etc.)
   If not found: Returns "Basic" (free) plan
   ↓
5. Frontend displays YOUR ACTUAL PLAN
```

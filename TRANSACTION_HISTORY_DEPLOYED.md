# 🎉 Transaction History Feature - DEPLOYED AND READY

## ✅ Implementation Complete

I've successfully implemented a complete **Transaction History** feature for individual users (couples) to view all their payment receipts across all bookings!

---

## 📋 What Was Built

### 1. **Backend API Endpoint** ✅
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/payment/receipts/user/:userId`
- **Location**: `backend-deploy/routes/payments.cjs`
- **Function**: Returns all payment receipts for a user with statistics
- **Database**: Queries `receipts` → `bookings` → `vendors` tables

### 2. **Frontend Service Layer** ✅
- **File**: `src/shared/services/transactionHistoryService.ts`
- **Functions**:
  - `getUserTransactionHistory()` - Fetch receipts
  - `formatAmount()` - Convert centavos to PHP
  - `formatDate()` - Format dates
  - `getPaymentMethodLabel()` - Get payment method labels
  - Filtering, sorting, and grouping utilities

### 3. **Beautiful UI Component** ✅
- **File**: `src/pages/users/individual/transaction-history/TransactionHistory.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - 📊 Statistics Dashboard (Total Spent, Payments, Bookings, Vendors)
  - 🔍 Search Bar (vendor, service, receipt number)
  - 🎛️ Filters (payment method, payment type)
  - 📈 Sort Options (date, amount, vendor)
  - 📅 Month Grouping
  - 📱 Mobile Responsive
  - ✨ Smooth Animations

### 4. **Router Integration** ✅
- **Route**: `/individual/transactions`
- **Protection**: Requires authentication
- **File**: `src/router/AppRouter.tsx`

## 🎨 UI Features

### Statistics Cards
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  💰 Total Spent    📄 Total Payments   📋 Bookings  🏢 Vendors  │
│     ₱100.00              1                1             1    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Search & Filter
- Real-time search across vendors, services, receipts
- Filter by payment method (Card, GCash, PayMaya, GrabPay)
- Filter by payment type (Deposit, Balance, Full Payment)
- Sort by date, amount, or vendor (ascending/descending)

### Transaction Cards
- Vendor name and rating
- Service type
- Payment badges (type, booking status)
- Amount and date
- Expandable details section
- Event info (date, location)

## 🚀 How It Works

### Flow Diagram
```
1. User logs in to their account
   ↓
2. Navigates to /individual/transactions
   ↓
3. Page fetches getUserTransactionHistory(user.id)
   ↓
4. Backend queries database:
   - Gets all receipts where booking.couple_id = user.id
   - Joins with bookings and vendors tables
   - Calculates statistics (total spent, payments, etc.)
   ↓
5. Returns receipts array + statistics object
   ↓
6. Frontend displays:
   - Statistics cards at top
   - Search and filter bar
   - Transaction cards grouped by month
   ↓
7. User can:
   - Search by vendor/service/receipt
   - Filter by payment method/type
   - Sort by date/amount/vendor
   - Click card to expand details
```

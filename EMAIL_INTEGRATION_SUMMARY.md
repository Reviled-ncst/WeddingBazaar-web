## 🔧 What's Already Working

**Features**:
- Nodemailer transporter with Gmail SMTP
- Environment variable configuration
- Automatic fallback to console logging
- SMTP connection testing
- Three email templates:
  - `sendNewBookingNotification()` - Vendor notifications
  - `sendVerificationEmail()` - User registration
  - `sendPasswordResetEmail()` - Password recovery

**Code Highlights**:
```javascript
// Automatically checks if email is configured
this.isConfigured = !!(process.env.EMAIL_USER && process.env.EMAIL_PASS);

if (!this.isConfigured) {
  console.log('⚠️ Email service not configured - emails will be logged to console');
} else {
  console.log('✅ Email service configured with:', process.env.EMAIL_USER);
}
```

### 2. Booking Integration
**File**: `backend-deploy/routes/bookings.cjs` (lines 890-940)

**Features**:
- Queries vendor email from database after booking creation
- Calls email service with booking details

**Code Highlights**:
```javascript
// After booking is saved to database
const vendorData = await sql`
  SELECT vp.business_name, u.email, u.first_name
  FROM vendor_profiles vp
  LEFT JOIN users u ON vp.user_id::text = u.id::text
  WHERE vp.id::text = ${vendorId}::text
`;

if (vendorData && vendorData[0].email) {
  emailService.sendNewBookingNotification(
    vendorData[0],
    bookingDetails
  ).catch(err => {
    console.error('❌ Email failed:', err.message);
    // Booking creation continues anyway
  });
}
```

### 3. Beautiful HTML Email Template

## 💡 Important Notes

### Email Failures Don't Break Bookings
The system is designed to be resilient:
- If email fails, booking creation still succeeds
- Errors are logged but not thrown
- Fire-and-forget pattern for performance
- Fallback to console logging in development

### Gmail Limits
- Free Gmail: 500 emails/day
- Google Workspace: 2,000 emails/day
- Consider upgrading if you exceed these limits

### Security
- Never commit EMAIL_PASS to Git
- Use app password, not regular password
- Rotate passwords periodically
- Monitor for unauthorized access

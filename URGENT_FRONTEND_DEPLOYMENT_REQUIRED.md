# üö® URGENT: Frontend Deployment Required - Payment Still Simulated

## Problem Discovered
The production frontend (Firebase) is using **OLD CODE** that simulates payments instead of calling the real PayMongo backend.

**Evidence:**
```
Console log shows:
üí≥ [CARD PAYMENT] Starting card payment simulation...  ‚Üê OLD CODE
‚úÖ [CARD PAYMENT] Payment simulation completed successfully ‚Üê FAKE

Should show:
üí≥ [CARD PAYMENT - REAL] Processing REAL card payment...  ‚Üê NEW CODE
üí≥ [STEP 1] Creating PayMongo payment intent...  ‚Üê REAL API CALLS
```

---

## Root Cause
The frontend code was updated locally but **NOT DEPLOYED** to Firebase Hosting. The production site is still serving the old JavaScript bundle that has the simulation code.

---

## Solution: Rebuild and Redeploy Frontend

### Step 1: Verify Local Code is Correct ‚úÖ

Check that local files have the real integration:

```powershell
# Check the payment service
type src\shared\services\payment\paymongoService.ts | Select-String "CARD PAYMENT - REAL"
```

Expected output: Should find "CARD PAYMENT - REAL" text

---

### Step 2: Build Frontend for Production

```powershell
# Clean previous build
Remove-Item -Path dist -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Build for production
npm run build
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚úì built in XXXXms
dist/index.html
dist/assets/index-XXXXX.js
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Check build output for errors. Build must complete successfully!

---

### Step 3: Deploy to Firebase

```powershell
# Deploy to Firebase Hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚úî Deploy complete!

Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/weddingbazaar-web/overview
Hosting URL: https://weddingbazaar-web.web.app
```

---

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

1. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"
   - Or use **Incognito/Private window**

2. **Open Production Site:**
   ```
   https://weddingbazaar-web.web.app
   ```

3. **Check Console Logs:**
   - Press `F12` to open DevTools
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for these logs on payment:
   
   **OLD (WRONG):**
   ```
   üí≥ [CARD PAYMENT] Starting card payment simulation...
   ```
   
   **NEW (CORRECT):**
   ```
   üí≥ [CARD PAYMENT - REAL] Processing REAL card payment...
   üí≥ [STEP 1] Creating PayMongo payment intent...
   üí≥ [STEP 2] Creating PayMongo payment method...
   üí≥ [STEP 3] Attaching payment method to intent...
   üí≥ [STEP 4] Creating receipt in backend...
   ```

4. **Test Real Payment:**
   - Login ‚Üí My Bookings
   - Click "Pay Deposit"
   - Enter TEST card: `4343 4343 4343 4343`
   - Expiry: `12/34`, CVC: `123`
   - Click "Pay Now"
   
   **Should see:**
   - ‚úÖ Real API calls to backend (3-5 seconds)
   - ‚úÖ PayMongo payment ID (starts with `pi_`)
   - ‚úÖ Receipt generated (format: `WB-2025-XXXX`)
   - ‚ùå NO "simulation" text in console

---

## Step 5: Test with Invalid Card (Should Fail!)

After deploying, test with an invalid card:

```
Card: 4111 1111 1111 1111 (invalid test card)
Expiry: 12/34
CVC: 123
```

**Expected Result:**
- ‚ùå Payment should FAIL
- ‚ùå Error message: "Invalid card" or "Payment declined"
- ‚ùå Status should NOT change to paid

**Current Bug (Before Fix):**
- ‚úÖ Payment succeeds (WRONG!)
- ‚úÖ Any card number works (WRONG!)
- ‚úÖ Instant success (WRONG!)

## Complete Deployment Commands

Run these commands in order:

```powershell
# 1. Clean previous build
Remove-Item -Path dist -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# 2. Build for production
npm run build

# 3. Check build was successful
if (Test-Path dist\index.html) {
    Write-Host "‚úÖ Build successful!" -ForegroundColor Green
} else {
    Write-Host "‚ùå Build failed!" -ForegroundColor Red
    exit
}

# 4. Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy --only hosting

# 5. Wait for deployment
Write-Host "`n‚è≥ Waiting 30 seconds for deployment to propagate..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
Start-Sleep -Seconds 30

# 6. Clear browser cache reminder
Write-Host "`nüîÑ IMPORTANT: Clear your browser cache or use Incognito mode!" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "Then open: https://weddingbazaar-web.web.app" -ForegroundColor Cyan
```

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

### Frontend (Must Clear Cache!)
- [ ] Open https://weddingbazaar-web.web.app in **INCOGNITO** mode
- [ ] Console shows "CARD PAYMENT - REAL" logs
- [ ] Console shows "STEP 1", "STEP 2", "STEP 3", "STEP 4"
- [ ] No "simulation" text in console
- [ ] Payment takes 3-5 seconds (not instant)

### Backend
- [ ] Backend returns paymongo_configured: true
  ```powershell
  Invoke-RestMethod "https://weddingbazaar-web.onrender.com/api/payment/health"
  ```

### Payment Flow
- [ ] TEST card (4343...) works and creates real payment
- [ ] Invalid card is rejected (not accepted)
- [ ] Receipt generated with WB-2025-XXXX format
- [ ] PayMongo dashboard shows transaction
- [ ] Booking status updates correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing "simulation" logs after deployment

**Cause:** Browser cached old JavaScript

**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Use Incognito/Private browsing window
4. Check different browser
5. Verify deployment timestamp in Firebase console

### Issue: Build fails

**Cause:** TypeScript errors or missing dependencies

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Check for errors
npm run build 2>&1 | Select-String "error"

# Fix dependencies
npm install

# Try build again
npm run build
```

### Issue: Firebase deploy fails

**Cause:** Not logged in or project not configured

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Check current project
firebase projects:list

# Use correct project
firebase use weddingbazaar-web

# Try deploy again
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Summary

**Problem:** Frontend code updated locally but not deployed to production.
**Solution:** Rebuild and redeploy frontend to Firebase.
**Expected Time:** 5-10 minutes
**Critical:** Must clear browser cache after deployment to see changes.

---

**After successful deployment, your production site will:**
- ‚úÖ Use real PayMongo API
- ‚úÖ Reject invalid cards
- ‚úÖ Generate real receipts
- ‚úÖ Create actual payment records
- ‚úÖ Show proper error messages

**Run now:**
```powershell
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

Then **clear cache** and test!

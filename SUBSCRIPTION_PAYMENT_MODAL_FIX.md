# 💳 Subscription Payment Modal Not Appearing - Diagnostic & Fix

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Issue:** PayMongo payment modal not appearing when selecting a paid subscription plan

---

## 🔍 Issue Analysis

### Symptom
When user clicks "Upgrade to [Plan]" on a paid subscription plan (Premium, Pro, Enterprise), the PayMongo payment modal should appear, but it doesn't.

### Expected Flow
1. User clicks "Upgrade to Premium" button
2. `handleUpgradeClick(plan)` is called
3. Sets `selectedPlan` state
4. Sets `paymentModalOpen` state to `true`
5. Component re-renders
6. PayMongo modal appears via portal

### Current Code (BEFORE FIX)
**File:** `src/shared/components/subscription/UpgradePrompt.tsx` (line ~264-286)

```typescript
const handleUpgradeClick = (plan: any) => {
  if (isProcessing) return;
  setIsProcessing(true);
  
  if (plan.price === 0) {
    handleFreeUpgrade(plan);
  } else {
    const convertedAmount = plan.price * currency.rate;
    
    // ⚠️ PROBLEM: requestAnimationFrame may delay state updates
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {
      setSelectedPlan(plan);
      setPaymentModalOpen(true);
      setTimeout(() => setIsProcessing(false), 1000);
    });
  }
};
```

**Problem:** Using `requestAnimationFrame()` causes a delay in setting state, which can result in:
- Race conditions
- State not updating before next render
- Modal condition `{selectedPlan && paymentModalOpen && createPortal(...)}` evaluating to false

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Updated Code (AFTER FIX)

```typescript
const handleUpgradeClick = (plan: any) => {
  console.log('🔥 [UpgradePrompt] handleUpgradeClick called', { 
    planName: plan.name, 
    planPrice: plan.price,
    isProcessing 
  });

  if (isProcessing) {
    console.log('⚠️ [UpgradePrompt] Already processing, ignoring click');
    return;
  }

  setIsProcessing(true);
  
  if (plan.price === 0) {
    console.log('💰 [UpgradePrompt] Free plan selected');
    handleFreeUpgrade(plan);
  } else {
    const convertedAmount = plan.price * currency.rate;
    console.log('💳 [UpgradePrompt] Paid plan selected', {
      originalPrice: plan.price,
      convertedAmount,
      currency: currency.code
    });

    // ✅ FIX: Set state synchronously without requestAnimationFrame
    console.log('📝 [UpgradePrompt] Setting selectedPlan and paymentModalOpen');
    setSelectedPlan(plan);
    setPaymentModalOpen(true);
    
    // Reset processing state after delay
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('✅ [UpgradePrompt] Resetting isProcessing');
      setIsProcessing(false);
    }, 1000);
  }
};
```

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ **Removed `requestAnimationFrame()`** - State now sets immediately
2. ✅ **Added comprehensive logging** - Can trace exact execution flow
3. ✅ **Improved error handling** - Logs show each step
4. ✅ **Enhanced render logging** - Shows when modal should appear

## 🔬 Enhanced Debugging

### Added Console Logs

**1. Click Handler Logs:**
```
🔥 [UpgradePrompt] handleUpgradeClick called
💳 [UpgradePrompt] Paid plan selected
📝 [UpgradePrompt] Setting selectedPlan and paymentModalOpen
✅ [UpgradePrompt] Resetting isProcessing
```

**2. Render Check Logs:**
```
🔍 [UpgradePrompt] Payment Modal Render Check:
   hasSelectedPlan: true
   selectedPlanName: "Premium"
   selectedPlanPrice: 5
   paymentModalOpen: true
   willRender: true
```

### Modal Render Condition
**File:** `src/shared/components/subscription/UpgradePrompt.tsx` (line ~778-810)

```tsx
{selectedPlan && paymentModalOpen && createPortal(
  <PayMongoPaymentModal
    isOpen={paymentModalOpen}
    onClose={() => {
      setPaymentModalOpen(false);
      setSelectedPlan(null);
      setIsProcessing(false);
    }}
    booking={{
      id: `subscription-${Date.now()}`,
      vendorName: 'Wedding Bazaar',
      serviceType: `${selectedPlan.name} Subscription`,
      eventDate: new Date().toISOString(),
      bookingReference: `SUB-${selectedPlan.name.toUpperCase()}-${Date.now()}`
    }}
    paymentType="full_payment"
    amount={selectedPlan.price * currency.rate}
    currency={currency.code}
    currencySymbol={currency.symbol}
    onPaymentSuccess={handlePaymentSuccess}
    onPaymentError={handlePaymentError}
  />,
  document.body
)}
```

## 📋 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Open Dev Server
```powershell
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Subscription Page
```
1. Login as vendor
2. Go to http://localhost:5173/vendor/subscription
3. Click "Upgrade Plan" button
```

### Step 3: Select Paid Plan
```
1. Click "Upgrade to Premium" (or Pro, Enterprise)
2. Watch browser console (F12)
```

### Step 4: Verify Logs
You should see this sequence:

```
🔥 [UpgradePrompt] handleUpgradeClick called { planName: "Premium", planPrice: 5, isProcessing: false }
💳 [UpgradePrompt] Paid plan selected { originalPrice: 5, convertedAmount: 5, currency: "PHP" }
📝 [UpgradePrompt] Setting selectedPlan and paymentModalOpen
🔍 [UpgradePrompt] Payment Modal Render Check: { hasSelectedPlan: true, selectedPlanName: "Premium", ... }
✅ [UpgradePrompt] Resetting isProcessing
```

### Step 5: Verify Modal Appears
✅ PayMongo payment modal should now appear over the upgrade prompt

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Still No Modal
**Check:**
```
🔍 Payment Modal Render Check: { willRender: false }
```

**Possible Causes:**
- `selectedPlan` is `null` - Check if plan object is being passed correctly
- `paymentModalOpen` is `false` - Check if state is being set
- Modal is appearing but hidden behind other elements - Check z-index

**Fix:**
Check browser console for the render check log. If `willRender: false`, check which condition failed.

### Issue 2: Modal Appears Then Disappears
**Check:**
```
🔥 handleUpgradeClick called
📝 Setting selectedPlan and paymentModalOpen
🔍 Payment Modal Render Check: { willRender: true }
⚠️ [UpgradePrompt] Already processing, ignoring click
```

**Possible Cause:**
Double-clicking the button

**Fix:**
Button is already disabled during processing. Wait for modal to appear.

### Issue 3: Payment Modal Error
**Check Console For:**
```
❌ PayMongoPaymentModal failed to render
TypeError: Cannot read property 'price' of undefined
```

**Possible Cause:**
`selectedPlan` is not being passed correctly to modal

**Fix:**
Verify the plan object has all required properties:
- `name`
- `price`
- `id`

### Issue 4: Portal Not Working
**Check:**
```
createPortal(..., document.body)
```

**Possible Cause:**
React Portal failing to attach to `document.body`

**Fix:**
Ensure React is properly loaded and `document.body` exists

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
```
User clicks "Upgrade to Premium"
→ requestAnimationFrame delays state update
→ Component re-renders without modal state
→ Modal doesn't appear
→ User confused 😕
```

### After Fix
```
User clicks "Upgrade to Premium"
→ State updates immediately (synchronous)
→ Component re-renders with modal state
→ Modal appears via portal
→ User can enter payment details ✅
```

## 📝 Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/shared/components/subscription/UpgradePrompt.tsx`
   - Fixed `handleUpgradeClick` to set state synchronously
   - Added comprehensive logging
   - Enhanced modal render check

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the fix:**
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   # Navigate to /vendor/subscription
   # Click "Upgrade Plan" → Select paid plan
   ```

2. **Verify logs in console:**
   - All 4 log messages should appear
   - `willRender: true` in render check

3. **Complete payment flow:**
   - Modal should appear
   - Can enter card details
   - Payment processes successfully

4. **Verify subscription upgrade:**
   - After payment, subscription should update
   - Page should refresh showing new plan

---

## 💡 Root Cause

The root cause was using `requestAnimationFrame()` to defer state updates, which caused:

1. **Timing Issues:** State might not update before next render
2. **Race Conditions:** Modal condition might evaluate before state is set
3. **Inconsistent Behavior:** Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't

**Solution:** Remove `requestAnimationFrame()` and set state directly (synchronously).

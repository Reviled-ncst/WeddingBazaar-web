# 🔧 Calendar Availability Fix - Booking Status Recognition

## Issue Identified

**Problem:** Calendar showing all dates as available (green) even when bookings exist

**Root Cause:** The availability service was only recognizing these statuses as "confirmed/booked":
- `confirmed`
- `paid_in_full`
- `completed`

**Actual Database Statuses:**
- `fully_paid` ❌ (was not recognized)
- `downpayment` ❌ (was not recognized)
- `approved` ❌ (was not recognized)
- `quote_sent` (correctly shown as pending)

**Result:** Dates with `fully_paid`, `downpayment`, or `approved` bookings were showing as available instead of unavailable.

## The Fix

### Modified File:
`src/services/availabilityService.ts`

### Changes Made:

**Before:**
```typescript
const confirmedBookings = bookingsOnDate.filter((booking: any) => 
  booking.status === 'confirmed' || 
  booking.status === 'paid_in_full' || 
  booking.status === 'completed'
).length;
```

**After:**
```typescript
const confirmedBookings = bookingsOnDate.filter((booking: any) => 
  booking.status === 'confirmed' || 
  booking.status === 'paid_in_full' || 
  booking.status === 'fully_paid' ||        // ✅ NEW
  booking.status === 'completed' ||
  booking.status === 'approved' ||          // ✅ NEW
  booking.status === 'downpayment_paid' ||  // ✅ NEW
  booking.status === 'deposit_paid' ||      // ✅ NEW
  booking.status === 'downpayment'          // ✅ NEW (legacy)
).length;
```

### Now Recognizes All Paid/Confirmed Statuses:
✅ `confirmed` - Vendor confirmed booking  
✅ `paid_in_full` - Full payment received  
✅ `fully_paid` - Alternative full payment status  
✅ `completed` - Event completed  
✅ `approved` - Booking approved  
✅ `downpayment_paid` - Downpayment received  
✅ `deposit_paid` - Deposit received  
✅ `downpayment` - Legacy downpayment status

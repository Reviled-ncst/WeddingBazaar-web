# Vendor Profile Image Upload Implementation

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Cloudinary Integration**
- **Service**: `src/services/cloudinaryService.ts`
- **Configuration**: Environment variables in `.env`
  - `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dht64xt1g`
  - `VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=weddingbazaarus`
  - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=157394783888831` 
  - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=xj9YFXBguXPOwDsJxUkxhPGKc6I`

### 2. **Vendor API Service Updates**
- **File**: `src/services/api/vendorApiService.ts`
- **Methods Added**:
  - `uploadProfileImage(vendorId, imageFile)` - Uploads to Cloudinary
  - `deleteProfileImage(vendorId)` - Deletes from Cloudinary
- **Features**:
  - Direct Cloudinary upload (no backend required)
  - Automatic profile database update
  - Error handling and fallbacks

### 3. **Vendor Profile Hook Updates**
- **File**: `src/hooks/useVendorData.ts`
- **New Functions**:
  - `uploadProfileImage(imageFile)` - Hook wrapper for upload
  - `deleteProfileImage()` - Hook wrapper for deletion
- **Features**:
  - Loading state management
  - Error handling
  - Profile state updates

### 4. **VendorProfile Component Enhancements**
- **File**: `src/pages/users/vendor/profile/VendorProfile.tsx`
- **Fixed**: React hook order issues (moved all functions before early returns)
- **Added**:
  - Hidden file input for image selection
  - Upload and delete buttons with loading states
  - File validation (type and size)
  - Success/error feedback
- **UI Features**:
  - Upload button with loading spinner
  - Delete button (only shows when image exists)
  - Drag & drop ready (file input hidden)

## 🎯 How It Works

### Upload Process:
1. User clicks upload button → triggers hidden file input
2. File selected → validates type (image/*) and size (<5MB)
3. Uploads directly to Cloudinary using unsigned preset
4. Updates vendor profile in database with new image URL
5. Updates local state to reflect new image immediately

### Technical Flow:
```
VendorProfile.tsx → useVendorData.ts → vendorApiService.ts → cloudinaryService.ts → Cloudinary API
                                    ↓
                              Database Update (profile_image field)
```

## 🔧 Cloudinary Configuration

### Upload Preset: `weddingbazaarus`
- **Mode**: Unsigned (allows client-side uploads)
- **Settings**: 
  - Overwrite: false
  - Use filename: false
  - Unique filename: false
  - Use filename as display name: true

### Auto-Optimizations:
- Quality: `auto:good`
- Format: `auto` (WebP when supported)
- Folder structure: `vendor-profiles/{vendorId}/`

## 📱 User Experience

### Upload Button:
- Pink background matching app theme
- Shows loading spinner during upload
- Disabled during upload process
- Success/error alerts for feedback

### Delete Button:
- Red background for destructive action
- Only visible when profile image exists
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Loading state during deletion

### File Validation:
- Only image files accepted
- Maximum 5MB file size
- User-friendly error messages

## 🐛 Fixes Applied

### React Hook Order Issue:
- **Problem**: "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render"
- **Cause**: Function definitions after conditional early returns
- **Solution**: Moved all function definitions before early returns
- **Result**: Hooks now called in consistent order every render

### Missing File Input:
- **Added**: Hidden file input with proper ref and event handlers
- **Accessibility**: `aria-hidden="true"` since it's triggered by button

## 🔄 Testing

### Current Status:
- ✅ Server starts without errors
- ✅ Component compiles successfully  
- ✅ Cloudinary credentials configured
- ✅ Upload preset ready for use

### To Test:
1. Navigate to `/vendor` route
2. Go to Business Profile section
3. Click edit mode
4. Click upload button on profile image
5. Select an image file
6. Verify upload to Cloudinary
7. Verify database update
8. Test delete functionality

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Production:
1. **Error Handling**: Add toast notifications instead of alerts
2. **Progress Indicator**: Add upload progress bar
3. **Image Cropping**: Add image cropping before upload
4. **Multiple Images**: Support cover images and gallery uploads
5. **Validation**: Add server-side validation
6. **Optimization**: Add client-side image compression

### For Backend Integration:
1. **Database Schema**: Ensure `profile_image` field exists in vendors table
2. **API Endpoints**: Create backup endpoints for profile updates
3. **Webhook**: Set up Cloudinary webhook for upload confirmations
4. **Cleanup**: Schedule cleanup of orphaned images

## 📝 Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Cloudinary Configuration
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dht64xt1g
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=weddingbazaarus

```

## 🔗 Integration with Booking System

The uploaded vendor profile images will now be:
- ✅ Available in `VendorImage` component
- ✅ Displayed in booking cards
- ✅ Shown in booking details modal
- ✅ Used throughout the vendor profile display

This completes the vendor profile image upload implementation and should resolve the original issue where vendors couldn't upload their profile pictures.
